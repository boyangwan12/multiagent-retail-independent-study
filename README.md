# Independent Study: Multi-Agent Demand Forecasting System

**Institution:** Concordia University
**Program:** Master of Engineering in Quality Systems Engineering
**Timeline:** September 2025 - January 2026
**Focus:** LLM-powered multi-agent system for retail demand forecasting and inventory allocation

---

## Project Overview

Building a **3-agent demand forecasting and inventory allocation system** for retail using LangChain and OpenAI APIs. The system predicts store-week granular demand and optimizes inventory decisions to address critical pain points: inaccurate forecasting, location-specific allocation failures, and late markdown decisions.

**Core Prediction:** `demand_by_store_by_week` matrix (50 stores Ã— 26 weeks = 1,300 predictions per SKU)

**MVP Scope:** Archetype 2 - Stable Catalog Retail (furniture, 26-week season, 50 SKUs, 50 stores)

## System Architecture

### 3 Agents + Orchestrator

| Agent | Responsibility | Key Output |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Demand Agent** | Predict store-week demand using similar-item matching + time-series | `demand_by_store_by_week` matrix |
| **Inventory Agent** | Calculate manufacturing orders, allocate inventory, plan replenishment | Manufacturing order, allocation plans |
| **Pricing Agent** | Monitor sell-through, recommend markdowns | Markdown triggers, depth recommendations |
| **Orchestrator** | Coordinate agents through 5-phase seasonal workflow | Agent execution sequence, performance metrics |

### Agentic Features
- **Autonomous decision-making**: LLM chooses forecasting methods (Prophet, ARIMA, hybrid)
- **Reasoning & explanation**: Natural language explanations for all decisions
- **Semantic understanding**: OpenAI embeddings for similar-item matching
- **Adaptive behavior**: Method selection based on data availability and confidence
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Cascading decisions (Pricing â†’ Demand â†’ Inventory)

### Technology Stack
- **LLM API**: OpenAI SDK (gpt-4o-mini, text-embedding-3-small)
- **Agent Framework**: LangChain
- **Forecasting**: Prophet, statsmodels (ARIMA/SARIMA)
- **Data Processing**: pandas, NumPy
- **Storage**: SQLite, CSV/Parquet (local)
- **Budget**: <$5 LLM costs (~$0.05 per season)

## Development Timeline

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Environment setup, synthetic data generation
**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Similar-item matching with embeddings
**Phase 3 (Weeks 4-5):** Forecasting methods (Prophet, ARIMA, hybrid)
**Phase 4 (Weeks 5-6):** Inventory agent (manufacturing, allocation, replenishment)
**Phase 5 (Weeks 6-7):** Pricing agent + orchestrator
**Phase 6 (Week 8):** Integration & validation (MAPE <20%)
**Phase 7 (Week 9):** Documentation & final report

---

## Problem Addressed

Based on interviews with 5 retail practitioners, the system addresses:

1. **Inaccurate Demand Forecasting (PP-001)**: 20% forecast error on product launches
2. **Location-Specific Allocation Failures (PP-002, PP-015)**: 5 hrs/week firefighting + ongoing stockout/overstock costs
3. **Late Markdown Decisions (PP-016)**: **$500K lost margin annually**
4. **Inventory Optimization Challenges (PP-028)**: Balancing overstock vs understock across 50 stores

---

## Success Metrics (MVP)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **MAPE (Store-Week)** | <20% | Hindcast on synthetic data |
| **Bias** | Â±5% | Over/under-forecasting check |
| **Confidence Calibration** | 80%+ | Predicted confidence vs actual error |
| **Runtime (Initial Forecast)** | <4 hours | 50 SKUs, local machine |
| **Runtime (Bi-weekly Update)** | <30 min | Single update cycle |
| **LLM Cost** | <$5 | Total for full season (26 weeks) |
