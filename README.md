# Independent Study: Multi-Agent Demand Forecasting System

**Institution:** Concordia University
**Program:** Master of Engineering in Quality Systems Engineering
**Timeline:** September 2025 - January 2026
**Focus:** LLM-powered multi-agent system for retail demand forecasting and inventory allocation

---

## Project Overview

Building a **3-agent demand forecasting and inventory allocation system** for retail using OpenAI Agents SDK. The system uses **category-level hierarchical forecasting** to predict demand and optimize inventory decisions, addressing critical pain points: inaccurate forecasting, location-specific allocation failures, and late markdown decisions.

**Core Innovation:** "Forecast Once, Allocate with Math" - Category-level forecast (1 prediction) + hierarchical allocation (Category â†’ Cluster â†’ Store)

**MVP Scope:** Archetype 1 - Fashion Retail (Women's Dresses, 12-week season, 50 stores, 3 clusters)

## System Architecture

### 3 Agents + Orchestrator

| Agent | Responsibility | Key Output |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Demand Agent** | Category-level forecasting (Prophet+ARIMA ensemble), K-means clustering, allocation factors | Total season demand, cluster distribution, allocation factors |
| **Inventory Agent** | Manufacturing calculation (20% safety stock), 55/45 allocation, replenishment planning | Manufacturing order, store allocations, replenishment plans |
| **Pricing Agent** | Week 6 markdown checkpoint (Gap Ã— Elasticity formula), variance monitoring | Markdown recommendations (5-40%), re-forecast triggers |
| **Orchestrator** | Sequential handoffs, context-rich object passing, dynamic re-forecast enabling | Workflow coordination, variance alerts (>20%) |

### Agentic Features (OpenAI Agents SDK)
- **Context-rich handoffs**: Pass forecast/allocation objects directly between agents (no database queries)
- **Dynamic handoff enabling**: Re-forecast handoff enabled dynamically when variance >20%
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Approval modals (Modify iterative + Accept, no Reject)
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket streaming of agent progress
- **Guardrails**: Automatic output validation (fail-fast on errors)
- **Sessions**: Automatic conversation history management

### Technology Stack (Updated)
- **LLM**: Azure OpenAI Service (gpt-4o-mini via Responses API)
- **Agent Framework**: OpenAI Agents SDK (production-ready, v0.3.3+)
- **Package Manager**: UV (10-100x faster than pip)
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+ + FastAPI + SQLite
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn/ui + TanStack Query
- **ML/Forecasting**: Prophet, pmdarima (ARIMA), scikit-learn (K-means)
- **Budget**: <$5 LLM costs

---

## Development Timeline (10-Week Plan)

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Backend foundation (UV + FastAPI + database + ML functions)
**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Agent implementation (Demand, Inventory, Pricing, Orchestrator)
**Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):** API & integration (REST + WebSocket + handoffs)
**Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8):** Frontend (React dashboard + agent visualization + approval modals)
**Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10):** Testing & validation (Unit + Integration + E2E, MAPE <20%)

---

## Problem Addressed

Based on interviews with 5 retail practitioners, the system addresses:

1. **Inaccurate Demand Forecasting (PP-001)**: 20% forecast error on product launches
2. **Location-Specific Allocation Failures (PP-002, PP-015)**: 5 hrs/week firefighting + ongoing stockout/overstock costs
3. **Late Markdown Decisions (PP-016)**: **$500K lost margin annually**
4. **Inventory Optimization Challenges (PP-028)**: Balancing overstock vs understock across 50 stores

## Success Metrics (MVP - Archetype 1)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **MAPE (Category-level)** | <20% | Hindcast on mock data (Women's Dresses, 12 weeks) |
| **Bias** | Â±5% | Over/under-forecasting check |
| **Workflow Runtime** | <60 seconds | Full 3-agent workflow (Demand â†’ Inventory â†’ Pricing) |
| **Re-forecast Trigger Accuracy** | 90%+ | Correctly identify variance >20% |
| **Human Approval Rate** | Track | % of manufacturing orders approved without modification |
| **LLM Cost** | <$5 | Total for full MVP testing |
