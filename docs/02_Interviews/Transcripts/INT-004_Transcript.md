JaeYoon Lee started transcription

Arpit Nagpal   0:03
Funnily enough, I you and I took the summer internship track when I was doing the MMA. So I interned at BRP back then. Also it was in retail and then I switched to as a senior data scientist back then and I've been at since then.

   0:15
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   0:19
So coming to the workflow that you mentioned, is it possible you can probably like share the workflow and then I can go through each of the pointers one by one in the chat. I don't like recall each of the pointers that is shared.

JaeYoon Lee   0:33
It's fair. Like can can Boyang like share it? I'll take a notes. Yeah.

Boyang Wan   0:34
OK.
Yes.

Arpit Nagpal   0:37
Yeah, sure, sure. No worries.

Boyang Wan   0:45
All right.
Yes, so.

Arpit Nagpal   0:48
Also, I don't remember back then you had like different professors for different independent studies. We used to do it under Professor Shoaib. He used to like do all the independent studies back then.

JaeYoon Lee   0:57
Oh.

Boyang Wan   1:00
Oh yeah, that's like probably the capstone project. So we had a capstone already and.

JaeYoon Lee   1:01
Oh really?

Arpit Nagpal   1:05
Oh, no, no, it was. It was like, yeah, yeah. So yeah, also independent study since only like 20 people did it back then only like 20 people did an internship out of the 80. So you he didn't really give it to any other professors. He was like, you can do any independent study. So I continued my internship.

JaeYoon Lee   1:06
Oh, also independent.

Boyang Wan   1:13
Oh.

JaeYoon Lee   1:17
Oh, OK.

Arpit Nagpal   1:24
At the same firm and I have faced that in as a independent study, so I kind of paved my time there.

JaeYoon Lee   1:26
Oh.
Oh, OK. So it's like, um, actually like process, like your internship process as like another independent study.

Arpit Nagpal   1:34
Yeah. So I interned for eight months IDV instead of four, yeah.

JaeYoon Lee   1:38
OK.

Arpit Nagpal   1:41
Perfect. Yeah, so I see in the chat. Also don't feel awkward if I'm not looking at the camera because I have the chat open in the big screen. OK, so planning preseason MFP set sales margin, inventory targets, forecasting predict demand SKUs.

JaeYoon Lee   1:51
That's totally fine, yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   1:59
Buying create purchase orders based on forecast. OK, so so for planning which is basically pre-season, how it goes at Canadian Tire is so we work under two different models. So each store can either be company owned or company operated, so COCO.
Just jargon there and the other could be dealer owned, company operated. So the dealer owns the store but company operates it. So any planning that you that you're going at .01 is either done.
In sync with the dealer. So they do their promotions. We do a promotion that's across the country and then accordingly those promotions are planned and the orders are put in by the dealer or if in the other case if it's company operated the.
The how should I put it? The forecasting time period that you need is much smaller because the OPS channel is much more In Sync with those stores and how these cycles go is it? The planning is usually done one year ahead, so for example there.

JaeYoon Lee   3:09
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   3:09
Is a back to school season for 2026, right? It should already be planned on our end, on the on the corporate end and then that plan is shared with the dealers themselves. The dealers have a turn around time of going, OK, we don't want this in promo in our store, we want this.
They have their their forecasting done on their end as well, their demand forecasting done on their end as well and they set an order for us for us to do their replenishment. If that answers what you're looking at .01 or if you have any follow up questions like I'd be happy to answer there.

JaeYoon Lee   3:43
Mhm.
So basically like one year ahead you guys planned, right?

Arpit Nagpal   3:49
One year ahead for dealers, if dealers are involved in the entire planning chain. So again, there are two different planning we are looking at here. If a dealer is involved, it has to be one year ahead on the store and even on the Flyers. I'm not sure whether you've seen Canadian Tire Flyers.

JaeYoon Lee   3:52
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   4:07
Go in. So there are print Flyers, digital Flyers. Those Flyers are also done one year ahead and all and at the core Canadian Tire is a retailer. So marketing is kind of like the core vertical around which all the planning, all the forecasting, all the pricing is done.
So for one year for a dealer operated one and then in general it's 6 to 8 months if it's, yeah, yes, exactly. Yeah.

JaeYoon Lee   4:32
It's a month for the company company owned, OK.
That sounds good. And additional cluster for the like forecast like what like level do you guys like forecast like style like store like cluster or SKU. OK, SKU, SKU.

Arpit Nagpal   4:47
SQ.
It is always at SKU. So how it usually goes is we do it at a SKU level, but there are category managers for let's say for example home gym equipment, right? So there's a category manager who's who will be handling home gym equipment, so for him.

JaeYoon Lee   4:54
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   5:04
We provide them a SKU level forecast and then it's up to them how they manage the category across the forecasted demand.

JaeYoon Lee   5:07
Mhm.
OK.
And in terms of like forecast, like what inputs matter the most for you guys like seasonality, history or like promotions and any like kind of like?

Arpit Nagpal   5:27
If I have to broadly categorize it, I would say three things. One is weather or seasonality, and by that I just don't mean some like seasonal patterns historically, like for example, Canadian Tire has a different.

JaeYoon Lee   5:27
Variable set.
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   5:44
So we follow six season pattern. So back to school is one season, holiday is one season and like between changes of certain seasons also they are like separate seasons of them around which promotions are planned. How it really goes is we look at weather seasons, weather forecasts.
So if we know that the winter is not gonna be really harsh this time, we won't really push a lot of snow related equipments that are required, right? Just to manage our promotions, just to manage our inventory accordingly. And 2nd is obviously historical sales.

JaeYoon Lee   6:01
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   6:17
3rd is um.
If I put it correctly, it should be competitor data for us. That's like really core because let's be honest, Amazon has majority of the market share at this point of time, no matter what the category, no matter what the market, competitive data is really key.

JaeYoon Lee   6:27
Mhm, Yep.
OK.

Arpit Nagpal   6:39
Uh, when we're doing certain forecasts, Uh across all domains, so pricing, marketing, Um and other domains as well.

JaeYoon Lee   6:40
Mhm.
For the like this targets that like like financial targets or MFP, how do they like actually cascade like who says this MFP and or like financial targets in your company and how do they like cascade into like category or location plan?

Arpit Nagpal   7:13
So I don't really have very like in-depth answer to that, but I can I have a very like over overview answer. So it's cascaded up the hierarchy. So it's it always is coming from CEO office, OK for this particular commercial office like I I come under the CEO.

JaeYoon Lee   7:16
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   7:30
So for the CEO, you're looking at marketing altogether in terms of marketing your key KPI to go for in case of MFP is ROI. So if I'm putting in 1000 bucks, I have to make 2000 bucks out of it. That's like 100% ROI, right? So it depends on domain to domain.

JaeYoon Lee   7:40
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   7:50
Category to category as well of and these categories also change by season. So season is really at the core of all planning, all forecasting that you see. Canadian Tire is known to be a seasonal retailer and even at that core comes the loyalty program. So anything that's planned.

JaeYoon Lee   8:02
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   8:10
At the core is always the loyalty program. How do we increase our loyalty sales? How do we increase our loyalty penetration and even across banners? I know. I'm not sure if you know Canadian Tire also owns Sportcheck. They also own Marks. They also own Pro Hockey Life. So there are like other banners and other brands.

JaeYoon Lee   8:10
OK.

Arpit Nagpal   8:30
Also across which this MFP is done.

JaeYoon Lee   8:31
Mm.
OK. And since like you're you know like data science test role like I was like curious about like like currently like if you're you know like kind of some kind of project with the like forecasting model like I was like curious about what types of model are you like are you guys company are you using like these days and those like.
Question like measure accuracy, how do you guys measure accuracy and some kind of like variables like if you if like Canada tires are starting like like let's say new styles or like new stores with no like historical data, like how do you handle the like cold starts points like those are the questions I have.

Arpit Nagpal   9:14
OK, so the cold cold start models at the core, right? Um.

JaeYoon Lee   9:15
Yeah.
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   9:21
I can give you give it to you with an example. I mean we don't really go with complex models. I'll be honest. The reason being that for us implementing the model and at the core is how do we interpret the model. So we don't really go with very like high class causation models and all. It's pretty much for example I can give in a.
Use case where we were building out a model as to how we can select SKUs and then place it on a flyer, right? So there's there's an entire pipeline we built. OK, we need to ingest data about all our SKUs per SKU, how they have been performing, how do we do a forecast per SKU? OK, if we put a certain SKU on a flyer, how well it will perform?

JaeYoon Lee   9:55
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   10:00
There there are like certain factors such as cannibalization, Halo effects that you calculate per skew, you place it on a flyer, does it? Is it? Is it looking creative? There are there are optimization models built built for that and then so on coming to the cold start problem that you mentioned.
We haven't really like in my time here. I haven't really encountered any cold start problem as of yet, so I'm not sure whether I I'll be the right person to answer that. But I I believe that's that perfectly depends on the use case you're going with. There was one analysis if I recall we were looking at.

JaeYoon Lee   10:30
That's fine, like.
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   10:39
That geospatial data as to OK, where can we optimize our stores? The obvious answer was sales at the end, but again, doing just that rough analysis was still worth it. So not necessarily always you need a model sometimes like a basic insight works.

JaeYoon Lee   10:44
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   10:56
That's in this case, yeah.

JaeYoon Lee   10:56
Mhm. OK.
Hey, um like any of you guys have questions regarding like demo forecasting like oil?

Boyang Wan   11:12
Yes. So since we're we're we want to build a AI agent for forecasting. So are there any pain points that you guys are facing or like what kind of AI agent like you guys kind of want?
For the forecasting, yeah, that's that's my question.

Arpit Nagpal   11:34
So when you say forecasting, it's it's basically sales forecasting, right?

Boyang Wan   11:39
Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   11:39
OK.

Boyang Wan   11:43
Or or more like a quantity, let's say one SKU like how how many items we can sell this season and let's say if we want to forecast that.

Arpit Nagpal   11:58
I think the key pivot, at least for us, is at any given point of time, Canadian Tire has 250,000 active SKUs. But The thing is the sales and the expected forecast and the inventory changes.

Boyang Wan   12:07
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   12:13
With season or weather specifically and the and the problem is we work on a weekly basis in terms of POS or let's say promotions. So everything is done weekly.
What really is a challenge is the turn around time with certain weather exceptions, and that's really a pain point because we lose a lot of money in that case. So for example, there was a PO that came in for replenishment for snow shovels, let's say.
For the next month, but it didn't really snow the next month a lot because the weather pattern changed quite dynamically. Like weather patterns are very dynamic, right? And that changes the sales here and there for us. And the entire forecast changes. Your entire forecast gets messy even like let's say your forecast of three.

Boyang Wan   12:49
Mhm.
Yeah.

JaeYoon Lee   13:02
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   13:08
200 units of snow shovels being sold. If it didn't snow a lot, it might just be end up being 100 SKUs being sold. So those 200 are essentially like a loss for the company. They like there was no need to replenish it, but the POS came before and there's there's a lag between those two.
Two time periods and that's a very, very important.
Pain point for us, uh, at least right now, uh, that we are facing.

Boyang Wan   13:44
OK, cool. And what what kind of pipeline or like technology that you guys using for the whole forecasting work?

Arpit Nagpal   13:53
So you mean in terms of tech stack like which tech stack are you using? So, so we use a hybrid cloud of Azure and GCP and then all the core data is also like in house data centers as well and that's pretty much the same tech stack that we use to deploy our models as well.

Boyang Wan   13:57
Yes.
Mm.
Mm.

Arpit Nagpal   14:13
I my team personally uses GCP because like our my team is basically at the core of how the GCP usage goes, but it's more majorly a hybrid cloud. Each team has a different choice of either of the two.

JaeYoon Lee   14:13
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   14:29
On Azure, it's majorly data bricks and ML flow that they are using and on on GCP it's Vortex and Kubeflow that we are using to deploy models.

Boyang Wan   14:37
Mm.

JaeYoon Lee   14:40
And what it will be like typical like on a typical week of roughly like how many hours go to like data prep analysis, like meetings and firefighting if there's like urgent things, urgencies and reporting, can you like kind of like?
See like how many hours are divided into this these sections? Mm-hmm.

Arpit Nagpal   14:59
Yeah, sure, sure. So for us, majority of the time goes into data prep just because of the fact that we are, we are working with like not just first party data, we are working with GA4 data, we are working with.

JaeYoon Lee   15:06
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   15:15
External clients data. We even get data that we have bought from other organizations as well. Now we also get data from other brands. So for example, Canadian Tire has a partnership with RBC. We have a partnership with Vestjet. We have a partnership with Petro Canada. So we get data from other partnerships.
It as well about our own customers. So a lot of time goes into just combining all this data together and making it somehow interpretable and to feed into a model. So Dataprep is really, really key for us.

JaeYoon Lee   15:41
Mhm.
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   15:50
Visualization, not so much. And especially with like all the AI bots that we have at our disposal now, making visualizations is pretty easy. Making a model is like takes hardly a day now. But yeah, data prep if I like calculate, let's say 40 hours a week.
We should be like spending 50% of our time in data prep and at least 10 hours as to how we can convince the business as to what we have done. So essentially just model building and visualization just takes 10 hours out of the 40. So 20 hours into data prep, 10 hours into like business insights meetings going.

JaeYoon Lee   16:12
Mhm.
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   16:28
Through with the business and then the remainder 10 hours building a model or building visualizations on top of it.

JaeYoon Lee   16:30
Mhm.
OK, OK.
Um.

Henry Tang   16:39
Yeah, I have another question regarding the demand forecasting. So you mentioned the dynamically changing input like the weather data, how that affect your forecasting. Do you also take the like?
Policy uncertainty into consideration, for example, the tariff policy exchange like like dynamically in the recent one year. So how how do you deal with that kind of data? So do you also lose a lot of money due to the like policy changes?

Arpit Nagpal   16:56
Mm.
Yep, Yep, Yep.
Yeah.
Oh yes, we do. So the reason I say that is so Canadian Tire does not really manufacture anything. We are basically just selling it under a label or and we also select for the other brands. So for example Nespresso, you can buy an Nespresso machine at Canadian Tire as well, but the problem comes with the supply chains.
A lot of supply chains were failed. I would, I would use the word like I would use it in the past tense because now it's not anymore. So a lot of supply chains had to be changed. There was a lot of cost cutting as well around that that was done previously.
In the previous months. But the problem with these certain one off events is you can't really predict it. So there's no point actually forcing your forecaster to do anything like it. So something like the pandemic happens like once in 100 years. You can't forecast it, you can't predict it and these changes are.

Henry Tang   18:05
Mm.

Arpit Nagpal   18:07
More or less one off. So you don't need a forecaster for these things. So for example, in this case when the tariffs hit, all of our supply teams needed to be changed, which have now occurred. So now we don't really need to tackle the tariffs anymore. So there's no point us.

Henry Tang   18:12
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   18:26
Building any forecaster as to how we can do it. It's just a matter of us making our supply chains more, uh, dynamic and more smarter in that case.

Henry Tang   18:29
And.
So, so you just like undertake that like loss. So you just suck it up.

Arpit Nagpal   18:41
Yeah, I mean, you have to in one way or the other. They had to let go of a lot of people just because of that though. So that that's a bummer. But yeah, I mean for with one off events, it's better not to force your forecaster to do anything.

Henry Tang   18:42
Got it.
Mm.

Arpit Nagpal   18:56
Uh, because that might. Um.

Henry Tang   18:57
Hmm.

JaeYoon Lee   18:57
Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   19:01
Impact your results in like the other things with which you're actually trying to measure.

Henry Tang   19:06
Do you? OK, so do you also have a like economic backdrop like input in your forecast model? For example, the the macroeconomic condition in Canada is deteriorating. So do you also like take that into consideration?

Arpit Nagpal   19:23
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you have, you have like ingestions built from start scan. So start scan gives you a lot of free APIs that you can use to ingest economic data. So yeah, we do a lot of, we do use a lot of macroeconomics data for sure.

Henry Tang   19:25
But do do you?

Boyang Wan   19:25
Mm.

Henry Tang   19:31
Hmm.
So do you have a internal like economic prediction model or you just use the like the data outside directly?
Hmm.
Mm.

Arpit Nagpal   20:07
So we don't really need an internal model to essentially do it, yeah.

Henry Tang   20:07
Mm.
Got it. Got it. So.

JaeYoon Lee   20:12
Like, do OK. Yeah, yeah, you can go ahead, Henry.

Henry Tang   20:15
Yeah, may I know some like example macroeconomic data you input to the forecasting model?

Arpit Nagpal   20:21
Yeah, population per postal code per FSA.
Average spendings, average salaries.
Yeah, these are like really, really key. One really interesting one is birth rates because we sell diapers for example. So for any postal code that has very high birth rates for us to push selling diapers.
And like baby genies and all that stuff to that FSA or postal code is like really worth it. So yeah, these are like really, really good predictors for us. So at any given point of time, our loyalty customer base has 15 to 20 million customers. That's like half of Canada's population.

Henry Tang   20:50
OK.

JaeYoon Lee   20:53
Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   21:07
That's the kind of data that we work with on a regular basis. So these macroeconomic data per se is very valuable also. So there is per postal code, there is on an urban or rural classification that Statscan does and it updates.
Every year, just because they they do an evaluation. OK, has this postal code actually gone gone from a semi rural to a semi urban kind of environment? So these also classifications help our model a lot.

Henry Tang   21:41
Got it. Thanks. Yeah. So

JaeYoon Lee   21:44
Do do this.

Henry Tang   21:47
Yeah, I have, uh, one more follow up. So some economic data has like lagging effect or leading effect. Do you also take that into consideration?

Arpit Nagpal   21:50
Yeah.
No, not really. I mean to be honest, it's it's not like we don't really feel that's worth it at times like we have analyzed it. It hasn't really impacted the model results a lot and also like most of our models run on a monthly basis like.
We don't really have a lot of models that run weekly just because of the fact that the volume of data is too huge. The cost is not worth it for us at times, so yeah.

Henry Tang   22:19
Mhm.
Thanks.

Arpit Nagpal   22:29
No worries.

JaeYoon Lee   22:30
Yeah, I was just like curious like do you guys run like what is scenarios like price change, promo, uplift or like supply delays and where where do those like scenario lives like?

Arpit Nagpal   22:36
Yep, Yep. Yes, yes.
As in can can you elaborate on that?

Boyang Wan   22:43
Oh.

JaeYoon Lee   22:46
Where do like those scenarios live? Actually like where do like scenarios live like?

Arpit Nagpal   22:52
Live as in where do we like analyze those and host them again on the same like GCP or if you're depending on like where you're running your experiment on. So just to give an example if let's say I'm sending a push notification to.

JaeYoon Lee   22:54
Yeah, yes, yes, Yep.
OK.
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   23:07
100,000 customers I know I can easily ingest. So Braise is like a third party that runs that for us. So I can easily ingest that Braise data into GCP, quickly do a hypothesis test, do an uplift test, seeing OK if I sent it 200 customers, how many actually clicked on the push notification?

JaeYoon Lee   23:20
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   23:26
I actually how many actually opened the app, how many actually did what we instructed them to do in the notification altogether. So we have visibility to like each touch point that a customer does over the app or like through their credit card or their loyalty card.

JaeYoon Lee   23:39
OK.

Boyang Wan   23:50
Yeah, I just wanna ask, I I know demand forecasting is a huge thing, is is a big topic and you mentioned like the seasonality is probably one of your pinpoints and Henry was talking about the economic factors, value variables that may affect.
The result. So among all those different factors, like if we were build a AI agent to forecast the demand, what do you think that we should focus on?

Arpit Nagpal   24:25
If like are you talking about more of like for all retailers or just specifically CTC in this case?

Boyang Wan   24:30
Good.
Let's just say Canadian Tire.

Arpit Nagpal   24:37
Seasonality, like the lowest hanging fruit for sure. Yeah, yeah, just because for us, seasonality is a big factor based for all our SKUs, for all our categories. We do stress on seasonality a lot.

Boyang Wan   24:39
Said in that letter.

Arpit Nagpal   24:52
Um, and Canadian Tire is known to be sorry.

Boyang Wan   24:53
OK, well, what are you currently?
Sorry, I well, I just want to ask like what? What? What are you guys currently dealt with seasonality?

Arpit Nagpal   25:04
What we have currently done with, so we just use certain paid APIs. So I'm not really sure which APIs are actually ingesting the weather data for us, but we have certain paid APIs that we use for whatever like weather forecasts are there.
And that data is currently updated, if I'm not wrong, on a monthly basis. But again, in Canada you can never be sure about weather even on a 24 hour basis. So I can give you an example, a very funny one though.

Boyang Wan   25:21
Mhm.

JaeYoon Lee   25:21
It is.

Arpit Nagpal   25:40
So there is a Canadian Tire store in Etobico. And again, I'm going back to snow shovels because like it that's been a really fun one. So there was a snowstorm that happened last year in Toro. I'm not sure if like anyone of you knew of of you know about it. A huge snowstorm like knee deep.
Uh, snow was there and the store went out of like they went out of stock for snow shovels and like people were just lining up to get shovels there and like other snow removing equipments. But if that forecast would have been done like in a more better way, the store could have been replenished leading to like higher seeds for us.
So yeah, this is, uh, this is a very core problem that at least we face, uh, even in our marketing, our demand forecasting model as well.

Boyang Wan   26:28
OK, so so based on your observation, like I know Canadian Tire has this problem. Are other retailers or companies competitors also have the same one?

Arpit Nagpal   26:40
Depends on which categories they're going for, so.

Boyang Wan   26:43
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   26:45
I can say for for like retailers like Rona or Home Depot.

Boyang Wan   26:46
OK.
Mm.

Arpit Nagpal   26:53
For them it's it's a big problem, but for like retailers like Loblaws who are like more into consumables, it doesn't really matter for them. For them, assortments and which categories to go for, what promotions to run, that's more of a core problem rather than demand forecasting or replenishment.
Even for us, marketing is a core problem for us, like what really happens is around marketing itself, all the replenishment and demand forecasting is done. But again, it really boils down to which categories you're going for. So if I talk about Canadian Tire, our direct competitor first is Amazon.
Seconds Walmart. So like even for them if if I go by category, so let's say gardening and gardening is 1 category, right? So in that case, yes it would be a really good factor to to get into. So looking across categories rather than retailers for your use case.

Boyang Wan   27:32
Mhm.
OK.

Arpit Nagpal   27:50
Will be much more interesting and much more easier to dig into for that.

Boyang Wan   27:57
OK, cool. Thank you. Thank you for kind of narrow down the scope for us. Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   28:04
Yeah, no worries. No worries.

JaeYoon Lee   28:08
And um.
Any additional questions? I'm looking at it right now.

Boyang Wan   28:21
I think or do you have any suggestion for us like if we were to build those those things because we we don't want to solve like a we don't want to do the same thing that like you guys are already doing like a general solution for demand forecasting. We want to kind of like do something new or.

Arpit Nagpal   28:29
And.

JaeYoon Lee   28:31
Um, nice.

Boyang Wan   28:41
Or something that you you might need. Or you know other retailers might need.

Arpit Nagpal   28:47
Yeah.
So there is uh I I was just going through pointer three that you just mentioned. So with BCG we have built a solution known as Robson AI. So what Robson does is if you recall I was talking about a use case where like we were selecting SKUs.

Boyang Wan   28:56
And.

Arpit Nagpal   29:07
Putting it on a flyer. So that's what Robson is. So what Robson does is it determines at what price you should keep your SKU on and like which SKU to go for. So it's like a multifaceted AI that we have built that does everything.
Related to marketing and pricing and one.
Very. Uh.
Key drawback that we're faced with Robson is it's not, uh, really good with.
Factoring in inventory because inventory is always a lagging factor with planning. So if you're somehow doing a demand forecasting that if that's done 1st and then build building any model on top of it, what I'm trying to say is.
You can. You need to have inventory data. That's really, really key.

Boyang Wan   30:09
Mhm.

Henry Tang   30:12
Mm.

JaeYoon Lee   30:12
And.

Arpit Nagpal   30:12
So do a forecasting on inventory first rather than going for demand.

JaeYoon Lee   30:18
We'll do the forecast inventory first.

Boyang Wan   30:19
OK.

Arpit Nagpal   30:20
Yeah, because their inventory is always gonna be a lagging factor.

Boyang Wan   30:22
Uh.
The inventory means for each store or just in general or?

Arpit Nagpal   30:31
Even if you're doing that on a cat, like as simple As for a skew or a category also might make very huge impacts on the model.

Boyang Wan   30:41
Okay, yeah, that that that would be a cool topic that we can uh deep dive on.

Arpit Nagpal   30:47
Yeah, because all the all your inventory kind of boils down to how much replenishment is required per store, how your marketing is gonna run. That's like really core for any any.

Henry Tang   30:49
But yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   31:02
Company for sure.

Henry Tang   31:04
Yeah, I I have a follow-up question on this. So how long will it like lag? So when when we do the forecast, how, how far away or how how far away this horizon should we like predict?

Boyang Wan   31:04
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   31:06
Yeah.
So it depends on what like PO cycles companies follow, right? So like for us it's usually.
A month, a week, sorry, a year before planning and then replenishment cycle start six months before you can take a baseline and probably just pitch it and then or you can just keep it dynamic in that case. Like why? Why stick to a particular time and OK, I have to go with one year or six months.
Because The thing is each, so let's say Walmart, Amazon, each will have a different cycle that they follow based on how they have built their supply chains, how they have built their entire OPS. For Amazon, those POS might just be even for a matter of days because.
That's the kind of model that they have built, their warehousing model. But for Canadian Tire, since we've worked with dealers, there are a lot of people involved in between that PO cycle is much more longer. So in if you're able to somehow manage that dynamic, that dynamic PO cycle.
That might make our solution more generalized rather than very company specific.

Henry Tang   32:35
Yeah, I I OK, I I have another question apart from this. So when when your forecast doesn't match the reality, so for example then like for example you predict that some.

Arpit Nagpal   32:39
Yeah, sure, sure.
Yep.

Henry Tang   32:51
Car I will sell 100 unit but you only sell 50 unit. Then how do you like deal with this kind of discrepancy?

Arpit Nagpal   32:58
Yep.
So in the next forecast for similar features, you penalize the model for making a wrong prediction in that case.

Henry Tang   33:09
Got it. So you evolve your model from time to time.

Arpit Nagpal   33:11
Exactly. Continuous improvement. So you so there is one key topic that all retail companies work on. That's reinforcement learning. Without reinforcement learning, there's no point building a demand forecaster today and like each companies like they have a very different criteria like for us.

Henry Tang   33:21
And.
Hmm.

Arpit Nagpal   33:31
ROI up and it depends on which KPI you're chasing, right? So your feedback loop which I see is like the last pointer of three. That's again a very key problem for.
You to like chase if you're if you're building like a really smart solution, that feedback loop is really important because in that case you're just making a batch prediction and that's it. That's like a one off prediction you're doing.

Henry Tang   33:51
Mm.
Got it.
So it's like it's like like reinforcement learning algorithm. So do you do you build your reinforcement learning agents in your workflow?

Arpit Nagpal   34:17
No, not like we we build it as one. So there is a data ingestion, there is a model build, then there is a prediction section and then there is a feedback loop built within the same model that we do. We don't really like.
Build a separate agent for it because all these units have to be In Sync. I mean you can build it separately. In that case you'll you'll need like certain time functionality for it to be In Sync with the model, which I don't think is like quite efficient.
And it'll cost you more in terms of processing as well. But like like reinforcement learning is a very heavy word. I would say it can be as simple as you telling the model when it was right or wrong in like A10 fashion. You just add it as a feature back. That's like the.

Henry Tang   34:59
Mm.

Arpit Nagpal   35:07
Simplest feedback loop you can give. OK, you gave a prediction X let's say for the last month you were right. OK, I'm giving you the you. There's one column of let's say correct as a feature. I'm giving a value of one. In other case I'm giving you 0 so.

Henry Tang   35:22
Got it.

Arpit Nagpal   35:22
It can be as simple as that and then you can evolve on top of it so.

Henry Tang   35:26
Got it. Yeah, that's a very useful information. Yeah. Thanks.

Boyang Wan   35:35
Yeah, I think we're good, right, Jay?

JaeYoon Lee   35:38
Yeah, I think you're acting very good.

Boyang Wan   35:41
Yeah, because right now we're we're we're trying to build probably 2 agents, one for demand forecasting, the the other for like allocation maybe, but like the for demand forecasting.
This, this, this session really helps us like to narrow down what kind of, uh, agent we wanna build, what kind of forecasting we wanna do. Um, yeah.

JaeYoon Lee   35:59
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mhm.
OK.
Yeah, we had a like, yeah, we had other like 3 different interviews. It was touching more based on the like high level workflow. But now I think throughout this interview we have some sense of like demand specifically in the demand forecasting. So I think it will help a lot.

Arpit Nagpal   36:09
Perfect. Perfect. Glad I could do.
Yep.

JaeYoon Lee   36:28
Yeah.

Henry Tang   36:30
Yeah, um, so yeah, so Arvik, uh, so I I have another follow up, so.

Arpit Nagpal   36:37
Oh, it's OK. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. You still have 20 minutes, ma'am. You can take these 20 minutes if you want.

JaeYoon Lee   36:38
That's it.

Henry Tang   36:41
Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, we only focused on the forecasting, the demand forecasting part. So do you also like deal with the inventory allocation optimization?
On your daily work.

Arpit Nagpal   36:59
Uh, no. So I work in marketing. So whatever you just heard from me from a perspective of marketing and the reason I actually know about this is because for us, marketing really comes first before actually doing any demand forecasting.

JaeYoon Lee   37:07
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   37:16
So all the teams first need to know what we are, what our marketing plan is. So that's why I have certain touch points where like I get to interact with pricing, demand forecasting teams and others.

Henry Tang   37:21
And.

JaeYoon Lee   37:26
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   37:30
Uh, can you can you repeat what what you asked at the end? Uh is was it inventory that you said?

Henry Tang   37:35
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Inventory allocation optimization. So, so for example your your forecast doesn't match the reality. You need to reallocate or rebalance your inventory. So like how?

JaeYoon Lee   37:43
Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   37:44
But yeah.

Henry Tang   37:53
How do you redo the rebalance? So for example, there's a shortage in Canada and or in some province and then neither province warehouse has like abundant inventory you need to transfer from that warehouse to this warehouse. So do you also.
So do that optimization.

Arpit Nagpal   38:15
So I don't do it. I haven't really come across any team that's doing it. But from what you are saying, that's a classical optimization problem. So I believe like there must be some team doing it. I I'm just not aware of it. And then when it comes to.

Henry Tang   38:33
Mm.

JaeYoon Lee   38:33
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   38:34
Optimization. So I've worked with a very similar use case in my capstone, so I know how it can be solved. It's definitely a clear cut optimization problem like you probably just need to finalize which optimizer to for us to use. And yeah, since you mentioned optimization, CPLEX is something that we.

Henry Tang   38:40
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   38:54
Used as a tech stack as well since I I actually for I think I forgot to mention it. So CPLEX is something that we extensively use. We have like a CPLEX license as well and from what I know we might be moving to Grobi very soon.

Henry Tang   38:55
Mm.

Arpit Nagpal   39:10
Because right now our CPLEX is running on servers, it's not running on cloud. So if we have to run any optimization problem, we don't need to run it on a server that's like in house right now.

JaeYoon Lee   39:21
Mhm.

Henry Tang   39:21
Got it. Yeah. We learned about the curoy in in in McGill. Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   39:24
Yeah, yeah. Is it? Is it? Is it still Professor Javad?

JaeYoon Lee   39:25
It's optimization, yeah.
Yeah.

Henry Tang   39:29
Oh, no, it's Professor Rob. Uh, he's just new to McKeon, yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   39:34
Oh, nice, man. If it would have been Professor Jawad, half of your batch would have been would have failed the exam. So you must have heard. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK. Glad. Glad you know about it.

Henry Tang   39:40
Interesting.

JaeYoon Lee   39:40
Yeah, I heard that. That's it's crazy. What's crazy? Yeah.

Henry Tang   39:46
Mhm.

JaeYoon Lee   39:47
And like in for the like like reforecasting the reallocation thing like in in a high level like do you know like when like demand deviates from like plan what triggers this like reallocation? Is it like alert or is it like manual observations?
Like.

Arpit Nagpal   40:08
It really comes like I know for a fact that inventory reallocation takes a lot of cost, right? So and it's additional cost. So let's say your site planning cycle has started.
This inventory reallocation will always come between the cycles, so it requires any additional cost that you originally planned. So it always has to come from like from the higher up.

JaeYoon Lee   40:31
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   40:38
So I'm not sure, man. Uh.

JaeYoon Lee   40:41
Yeah, that's that's totally fine, right?

Arpit Nagpal   40:42
Yeah, I mean I I it definitely is a very big overhead cost like you and with the kind of so there are like 1700 stores we cater to at Canadian Tire. So for us to do our inventory reallocation like that's a very huge cost to do and again going back to the fact that.

JaeYoon Lee   40:52
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   41:00
R is a more hybrid network where some stores are dealer operated, some are operated by us and on the dealer end we cannot do any inventory reallocation if the dealer does not ask for us to do. So the dealer always has to put in a PO for us to process it on a store on our own stores.

Boyang Wan   41:14
Mm.

Arpit Nagpal   41:20
We can do it, but again that's a very huge cost and we are looking at like moving products from like 1 store to another through trucks and like flights and all that stuff. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's a lot of cost at the end of the day. So you need to have a very strong case for you to actually go for a inventory reallocation.

Boyang Wan   41:30
Thank you.

JaeYoon Lee   41:34
OK.

Arpit Nagpal   41:40
If you have to do it, but it does happen for sure. A lot of stores do it.
But there will always be a lagging factor there also for sure that you have to consider if you're planning to like go for that use case.

Boyang Wan   41:56
Yeah.
Mhm.
PO you mean purchase order, right?

Arpit Nagpal   42:05
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JaeYoon Lee   42:06
Mhm.
And for the like for the markdown processes like how do like actually like markdown like get decided like what are the like triggers or the cadence and who signs like this off like just like general information could be also fine for this.
That's fine, yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   42:30
Um, could you give me an example of such a process?

JaeYoon Lee   42:34
Like so let's say like when and why do items get like marked down? Like what specific triggers like sell through like percentage or the aging? It could be like WOH.

Arpit Nagpal   42:45
Yeah. So aging is 1, sales drop off is a huge one. I mean sales drop off is a very huge one if inventory is really high and it has been high for a particular product for like really long.

JaeYoon Lee   42:58
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   43:01
There could be reverse markdowns as well that we have seen where we know that from Google data we know that for example pink Nespresso and this is very funny one, but we have seen this pink Nespresso machines have been really in the.
Trend for the past four months. So we would want that to go like we would want that inventory to go high throughout stores. That's like a reverse mount on that that you're talking about. So it it it usually is sales and trends.

JaeYoon Lee   43:21
Mhm.
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   43:34
And by trends, I mean online trends, like shopping trends. Someone's like adding them to their cart, but not really buying it. But that means that's still in demand. So we won't really go for a markdown for that SKU particularly, but it's always done at a category level. So the category manager is the one who is.

JaeYoon Lee   43:48
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   43:54
Owning that and I know for a fact Amazon also at Amazon also category managers are the one that actually handle it. So if the category manager says no, this SKU does not go on a markdown, nobody can question them.

JaeYoon Lee   43:55
Mhm.
OK. I think your manager has all those like markdown decisions. OK.

Arpit Nagpal   44:11
Yeah, they are. They are basically managing that entire category. So they own that SKU assortment under that category.

JaeYoon Lee   44:15
OK.
OK.
Do you know any by chance like how often this like markdowns get reviewed?

Arpit Nagpal   44:26
Every quarter, yeah.

JaeYoon Lee   44:28
Every quarter.

Arpit Nagpal   44:31
Every quarter and then the hierarchy changes every year in that case, because some SKUs just become obsolete, right? So in that case you have to change your hierarchy. In some cases, new SKUs get entered into the hierarchy. So that also happens for us.

JaeYoon Lee   44:46
Mhm.

Arpit Nagpal   44:49
That hierarchy change happens annually, but the markdowns happen quarterly because our SKU planning promotions planning also done is like finalized and done quarterly. So let's say for Q 4/20/26.

JaeYoon Lee   45:00
And well.

Arpit Nagpal   45:05
Our promotional planning has already started.
That's why I told you about that one year cycle, right? So first you plan your promotion, then then it goes on following that.

JaeYoon Lee   45:12
Mm mm mm.
Yep. I think we're good. Any Any other questions?

Boyang Wan   45:32
Are you Are you in Toronto right now?

Arpit Nagpal   45:34
Yeah, yeah, I'm in Toronto right now. I've been in Toronto for the past three years, almost now.

JaeYoon Lee   45:36
Hmm.

Boyang Wan   45:41
OK, uh 'cause I went to Canadian entire office last year for like Toronto trip like the company visit. Uh, I forgot where that was. I think it's it wasn't.

Arpit Nagpal   45:53
2180 uh, Midtown. That's Midtown Toronto.

Boyang Wan   45:57
Is is it in downtown right like the?

Arpit Nagpal   45:59
No, no, no. That's Midtown Toronto. There's no. Yeah, yeah. Can entire. That's the headquarters that you went to the 2180 Young St. I believe building. That's quite an old building though. Sorry, you had to see that one.

Boyang Wan   46:01
Oh, midtown.
Hey.

Arpit Nagpal   46:14
Uh, but yeah, it's it's getting renovated as we speak, so hopefully you'll see a new office soon.

Boyang Wan   46:22
That that's cool because I also went to the uh, what is it called? Like the ideation hub or like a designer hub and where they design all the product and it was really cool.

Arpit Nagpal   46:31
Yep.
Yeah, yeah. They've they have like a lab and then a store where like employees can go and like buy the faulty products or like the experimental products that they have built. You can just pick it up and see, OK and you get like a discount on them at times. So what what really happens in our categories is say there are certain brands.
Brands that we sell with the brands and then there are certain brands that we own as well. So MasterChef is one that the entire owns solely. So in that case we get to like experiment around with the products. That's what you saw in the lab as well I hope just for those brands. So we can't really.

Boyang Wan   46:55
Mhm.
Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   47:13
Mess up with any Nespresso machine, but we can mess up with any like Kurig machine. At times we can do that.

Boyang Wan   47:16
Yeah.
Oh, wow. That's that's interesting. Yeah, I I I didn't know that. Uh, all the employees like you, you, you're like, uh, all of you guys. Uh, we are sleep.

Arpit Nagpal   47:25
Yeah.
Well, we never really get anything, to be honest, because whenever you go, they're like out of stock, somebody's or has already been there, they just pick it up and just leave at times. Yeah, that really, that's quite frequent.

Boyang Wan   47:43
I see. I see. That's good. I'm. I'm off. Yeah, go ahead.

Arpit Nagpal   47:45
So they're like, yeah, there are three offices actually on that crossing. So Canadian Tire has three offices there and then there's one office in Oakville, but in Oakville it's mostly the Canadian Tire bank employees.

Boyang Wan   47:52
Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   48:01
Network from there.

Boyang Wan   48:02
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know another. Uh, MMAI think. Uh, what is this? Christian. Christian. Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, he's he's working in the finance, right?

Arpit Nagpal   48:22
Yeah, he's in. He's from MMA 5 and then I'm from MMA 4.

Boyang Wan   48:25
Yeah.
Yeah, I I met him, uh, last week. Uh, two weeks ago, I think.

Arpit Nagpal   48:32
Oh, nice.

JaeYoon Lee   48:32
Mm.

Boyang Wan   48:33
Yeah, because uh, right now I'm, I'm also at Toronto and uh, I'm the ambassador for MMA 7 in Toronto. So like we have those uh meetups from time to time. You should join us.

Arpit Nagpal   48:36
Yeah.
I haven't really been to any of the meetups. I I don't recall. I have been to any of the meetups. We don't really have a really good ambassador. Sorry, just don't skip it to any other. It's just a gossip. I'm telling you, I I'm not sure whether any of the MMA fours were there the last time.

JaeYoon Lee   48:49
Oh.

Arpit Nagpal   49:04
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I I don't think a lot of MMA fours go go to these meetups, but I know now they have been really trending with like the MMA fives and forward. I know some MMA threes that are really like active there. I have a few friends from the MMA threes as well, but I'm not sure what the.

Boyang Wan   49:04
I don't even know us.

JaeYoon Lee   49:08
Mhm.
And.

Boyang Wan   49:16
Yeah.
Yeah.

Arpit Nagpal   49:23
Of course.

Boyang Wan   49:25
Uh, I see. I see. Yeah, because we.

Arpit Nagpal   49:27
Yeah, do hit me up, man. Like whenever like there's an event, I would love to like come and meet you guys up for sure.

Boyang Wan   49:34
Oh, cool. Yeah. Thank you so much. I I didn't expect this because uh, I didn't know like what kind of position you're you're you're working on. Like I thought that you won't know that much details in all those process. But yeah, you provide so many, so so much good information for us.

JaeYoon Lee   49:34
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

Arpit Nagpal   49:51
Oh, no worries, no worries. Happy. Happy to help you guys for sure.

JaeYoon Lee   49:55
Thank you so much.

Arpit Nagpal   49:56
Yeah, thank you guys and good luck. Good luck with the project. And like in case you need any other information, you can just hit me up on LinkedIn anytime you want and you have my e-mail as well. You can just e-mail me.

JaeYoon Lee   50:00
Thank you.

Boyang Wan   50:09
Thank you so, so much. Yeah, thank you.

Arpit Nagpal   50:11
Yeah, no worries. No worries. Have a good one, guys. Bye, bye.

JaeYoon Lee   50:12
Thank you so much. Have a good one. Bye.

Boyang Wan   50:14
Have a good one. Bye.

Henry Tang   50:16
Yeah. Bye. Thanks.

Arpit Nagpal   50:17
But.

Boyang Wan   50:20
All right. Let me drag him in.

JaeYoon Lee   50:22
Where is Henry?

Boyang Wan   50:26
Where is he?

JaeYoon Lee   50:27
Oh my God, my head hurts.

Boyang Wan   50:29
You can stop the recording now.

JaeYoon Lee   50:33
Oh yeah.

JaeYoon Lee stopped transcription
