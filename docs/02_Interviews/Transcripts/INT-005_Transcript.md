Hello?
Can you hear me? Yes. Hello?
Hello, how are you? All good? Yeah, I'm doing good. Right now I'm at work. So that's why you see a different background. How's your study going on? We're doing the independent study with Dr. Fadhid. That's why we want to do some interview together, some pain point and stuff. He's working in the retail, so he wants us to do some retail stuff.
Yes, Professor Patil, he works in retail. I think he was in Aldo for quite some time. So, yeah, I think independent study, it's all for the students, you know, like to... Get a project and get it completed and it should be good enough, you know, like to get the creating as well as to get like an experience. So, yeah. So is it just you or like you got a team who is working on it?
I have another four classmates working on the same project, but they're not available today so I'm just gonna... I'm going to ask you a couple of questions. For sure. It's fine. I just read through the message that you sent so like it was like a very, I mean it was covering like a lot of things in it, you know, like usually I...
Just based on my experience, I think that would be too much to cover all aspects of it. Instead of it, it's good to focus on one. It's not like you have to do everything across different areas. Domains in retail related to inventory or revenue or finance, you know, like I mean it's you just should stick with like one data set Yeah, and then probably, you know, like try to find the use case on I mean on that data that can be worked on
That use case can be anything related to building a simulator using some machine learning thing or like agentic model using JNI, you know, like to... It is a voice memo. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. Any estimates to it? But yeah, go ahead. It would be good if you could give a little bit just about what exactly you guys have not finalized to work on and probably I can...
Are you sure you want to put it on the JTAS? four interviews already, and we kind of narrowed it down to just one topic, which is just demand forecasting. We have a general idea already. I can share my screen. What we want to do... Yeah, I don't know if you can see this. Yeah, that's why I have to pick up my phone, just to say. I'm just logging into my screen. Okay.
We just want to build a multi-agent forecasting system. The key problem we want to address is the seasonality. Seasonality doesn't mean summer or winter. It means the Black Friday season or back to school season. or some season that the company would define for their businesses and then we yeah cut you there like so forecast like it can be a lot of things like it can be related to inventory or sales or yeah anything
Select what you guys are focusing on here. We just want to focus on the cells, like the quantity of the SKU.
Okay yeah I mean SKUs obviously is nothing but like products of different categories. Yeah. So like do you know like what sort of like products You are going to capture it in your dataset because there are a lot of categories of products. It can be related to fashion or groceries or electronics, etc.
Because retail is huge. So it can be fashion retail or CPG, consumer packaged retail companies like P&G, PepsiCo, they are CPG companies. Then comes Walmart, those are like the real retail companies selling groceries. You know, like selling products of CPG companies too, right? So, I think there are different sects within retail which you should use.
You guys should also check it out. So for the data set, we haven't explored it yet. So the product category will. depend on the data set we can find. But I guess for this interview, if, let's say, because you worked in that. This kind of solution, we want to forecast the sales for a specific season, like Black Friday season. What would you do, or based on your experience, do you know the workflow or some pain points that they have regarding to demand forecasting?
summer or winter or which type of weather it is which you have already written which is right. Second is obviously seasonality can vary based on like the sail. sale on the product that comes in. It can be let's say during festivals like Christmas or Halloween etc you know or like there can be you know like season.
Not I would say like seasonality as such but you know like if there are like uh period where there are like heavy discounts just to get rid of like the inventories of the stocks. where exactly they are placed at the front or at the side of the stores you know like depending on that as well like the sales of the clothes vary you know like because it depends on like the first impression of the customer.
So, there are a lot of factors into it as well, as well as the inventory as we have mentioned here. That also plays an important role if some products are like... where there are spikes in the sentence, you know. So that is second important thing and third is the inventory.
It has been edited to include proper punctuation. Historical data, like why I said there are certain stuff which companies want to get rid of it or put them on sale so that they can empty their inventory, that sort of pattern you can also use historically because the past has put it in a happy time.
So, that is there. Here in the data agent layer because at the end of the day we need a lot of variables to predict the sales and so we kind of just want to group them into several agents so they can process or like. get activated based on the scene that we were predicting. One more thing is like social media as well. So I mean as you know like there are a lot of new trends that come on like every day or every few weeks. So that is also really a lot.
Things related to fashion is also involved there. So based on that, you know, like the bike pattern or the customer changes too. So, you know, like that is also like one of the factors. This I'm just giving you like the oldest view. So based on like what data you are able to gather, so it will depend on that, like what sort of metric or the KPIs that you have within it.
The easiest thing that you can find out is the weather, like the seasonality. And basically on the seasonality comes the weather pattern as well as the... If you have that data, then obviously you can find a correlation between inventory and the sales.
So that is there too. In historical, you have to see what sort of other metric you have and whether you can find any correlation between. sales or yeah basically with the sales. So I mean in AI as well like you have to use machine learning you know like if you're writing some codes in it.
Like whatever metric that you have in the data set, like let's say if you have a hundred columns in it and obviously in that you will have the categorical columns and numerical columns, right? So categorical among them you have to find like what's the correlation
Based on which the sales and the inventory number are varying. And when you see a significant correlation, then basically you choose those columns. And then make your model around it. And then you feed it in your agent so that. They understand that, and then they give you answers.
It has been quite some time since I've used it, but mostly it was related to... The forecast is usually for the sales number and inventory numbers So I mean you just have to find a use case like what sort of metric can be used Not use exactly, but that you need to find out the data that you have. So even let's say if I have like some data of company, right? So in there I have to take into like the other metric.
within that data set which is correlated or which is affecting the sales and inventory numbers. So it's like you have to dig more into it and do some research. There are a lot of correlations and finally you will come to it. And if you are not able to find it on a specific dataset, then you increase your database.
You bring in like other tables which are related to it. Which can connect at basically yeah, the the data set could be tricky like me. At the end, maybe we'll just create some mock data, like synthetic one. I mean, you can refer to Kaggle, you might have heard of Kaggle, right? Yeah.
So, there are a lot of free public data sets that you can use. Probably you can refer to that. There are multiple data sources, so you can play around with a few of them and then see which one makes more sense and is giving you... Good results based on the algorithms that you have learned.
So what did you do when you were in that company?
During my time, agentic AI wasn't there. These days, you have agentic AI. You can create one by treating them with data and instruction, like what exactly they... should response based on a user inputting some text into that agent AI, and then they run their own algorithm and do the analysis, right? But during my time, how it was, was like we have to...
I mean, obviously, the algorithm was there, but we have to work more on it, by that what I mean. It's like you have a particular dataset, let's say you have to make some sales focus, right? And then you have like a data set which has like 100 columns, and then within those 100 columns we used to figure out which metrics are correlated to states. So we used to run some correlation models using like theoretics.
Spearman and Peirce and correlation models, these are like the, obviously the first step was cleaning up the data, removing like whatever anomalies that we had into it, making the data clean, so that used to take like, 50% of the time, like more than that. So once we had that, then we used to run a correlation model with the metrics. So there also we used to have like three, four models, different algorithms that we used to run. And then the one which...
I used to, you know, shuffle the data set so that we can get multiple outputs using this D-Score addition model and make the one which used to. We used to take that, and then go into the next step of building sub-models. There are time series models that you might have heard of, like the ARIBA model.
So we used to use that later to feed that data into that model. And we used to get a forecast for whatever time frame you wanted to have. Majority of the time I used to go into the historical data, cleaning it up, bringing it in a format which is useful, which is clean and it can be used to run the models.
So, mostly it was like three or four time series that we used to run. And then post that, after that we used to create a simulator. And simulator, I mean, it doesn't have to be fancy. Even like if you have... Your simulator is like a user puts some number and then they get a scenario of what you should be and what the expected output should be. So we used to have like an Excel worksheet or we used to have like a Power BI, you know, like...
So this is what I mean, I did at that point of time. It was like, I would say a few years back. So, and yet right now like you have like way more tools. at your disposal, which evade your heavy lifting tasks, like doing coding, or doing data cleanup, or those sort of stuff, or even.
breaking your head, you know, like, writing codes, you know, like the syntax and all the stuff right now you can use in here and click for a lot of things. Okay. So that's that's that was my time I used to do that. So what kind of use case were you doing at that time?
It was for a CPG company, I think Mondelēz, so it was basically, you know, like...
Basically letting them know how to set up the prices of the product. That we used to predict. Based on the inventory that we used to have and certain seasonality factors. We used to consider the time frame for it, in which month it is spiking. and then based on that you know like which duration is good to have more stock so that like the sales increase during that time and like for the rest of the year.
Like, what's the best way to optimize by like optimizing the cost of the, you know, like different, they make a lot of chocolates and biscuits and cookies, right, so. It was mostly related to that category of products that I was working for like one specific geography. I think it was like Southeast Asia.
OK. That's pretty interesting. So how did you guys identify those use case, or just any other use case that could be related to demand forecasting?
So this use case, you know, like I would say that it's not 100% kind of like forecasting as such, I would say more or like a prediction model, right, you know, like That use case was more like the predicted modeling. So, you know, like, it's like, you
have historical data now and based on that you know like you used to predict like what's probably going to happen. Let's say you haven't studied data for 10 years. And you see the trend, like you're able to get that out. So probably it's on that, like you are prescribing, okay, like for next year, like what one should be doing. And.
by doing X, Y, Z, by increasing your inventory or, you know, like moving your product to, you know, like a heavily, I mean, densely populated area or, you know, like even I mean, even using the demographic data, we used to do that. I would say it wasn't a 100% automated process because in between there used to be some manual process where a person has to...
This is a voice memo. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. That process was obviously, it was supposed to be done. So a lot of insights need to be generated, and then it was passed on to business users.
Pretty cool. So, are there any pain points?
Pain point, I would say, I mean, that depends. Because obviously there is a room of, you know, like. Things aren't going the way one is expecting. So like, the pain point was, you know, like, making sure, like, let's say the stocks are... It is not overly stocked. They don't pay more stock. It is at an optimal level, backed by the historical numbers. Over the year, we have seen an increase of 2%, 3%, 5%, whatever that number is.
We make sure that we have that much stuff over stock in our inventory, but not exceeding those numbers. This is just one example. But let's say, for example, you know, uh,
I wouldn't say it's a pain point, but I would say this is a few of the drawbacks that one can probably face, and these are a few of the ways how they can handle it. Okay, I see. Because after our demand forecasting, we also want to kind of do what you just said, like the inventory rebalance or reallocation depends on the warehouse we have in this area and some store may have shortage, some store may have surplus, and we kind of reallocate it.
So in that case, our demand forecasting will. It would have to be the demand for a specific store and then for another store. And if the real data doesn't match, then we have to do the reallocation. That's what we are thinking of. Basically, here one has to make a use case around it, like how you manage these situations which can't be controlled.
So obviously one is taking care of the demographic situation of where the stores are, what sort of stocks and the things that they are selling. And even like let's say the data that you're dealing with also have like warehouses right and they also deal with like let's say for example online sales like you know like they also take online orders.
There can be a connection between store sales and online sales, where people can come to stores, they can place order, but their order will be dispatched from warehouse and they will get on XYZ timeframe if that store doesn't have that stock. Even it can be shipped from nearby stores if they have that stock. If they have that stock, the store from where the order was placed, it has that right. So that's sort of like interconnectivity. So that sort of things can also be done.
These talks are not, you know, like, there are too many, one kind of product at one place, but it can be like. Even that can also be used to handle deficient sales. have to be considered for this optimization problem after the demo. I mean, that's what we call it, like, open channel, right? So you have, like, multiple channels to the, like, can we put brick-and-mortar online, or...
Yeah, so that's sort of a thing. So like this only channeling stuff like I mean, it's good to keep in mind You know, like can you use it in your use case so that? It will give you more points to showcase while you are talking about the project, or presenting it, or submitting it.
Yeah, definitely. Are you also working on the same kind of things in Walmart right now? No, not exactly. Here I'm more on the policy making team, where they make policies related to safety. I mean, safety can be within stores. food safety, customer safety, but even like related to trainings, you know, so dealing with like that sort of a data. So yeah, that's that's the
You can say like the governance team, which makes policy, and I work with their data to generate insights out of it. Completely different use case, but still dealing with data. Data is everywhere. For example, Walmart is very huge. They have a lot of data. They have different departments.
Omnichannel, you have the merchandising department, you have the governance team, you have the legal and financial teams. Everywhere they have data. You have to utilize them for these things. For example, for me, I deal with training data or the... You can see the policy data. So it is very important because there are certain things that need to be tracked on a daily basis.
Those are the things being followed at stores, or in general in the operations, not, you know, so it's I mean every SMAs I would say like departments have their unique role or use cases and like everywhere they have data where you can get something out of it.
Interesting. Last Saturday, did you go with Stephen and Anaya to the restaurant? We went to a couple of places. I think we decided on Beard Market. I think we need to forward it to the... MMA admin team, let's see what they say. So where are you right now? In Montreal or Toronto?
I'm in Toronto. I'm in my company right now actually, yeah. Okay, so like I think this is September, right? So are you part of like in-person or online cohort? I'm in-person cohort. I'm MA7. Okay, so for the classes, you might have to go back after some time, right? No, no, no. I'm just taking this independent study online.
It's just doing a project, and Dr. Fatigue is going to check in with us every week for 30 minutes.
Oh, oh, okay, okay, I got it. So like, what I was asking you is like, there would be a semester going on right now, right? If there will be three, four. Okay, so once again, MMA is seven. And right now like, the new card is MMA eight, right? If I'm not wrong.
Okay, so you're done with the majority of your courses, so this is kind of like your last semester that is left out and you're doing an independent course to finish your credits, right? Yes, yes. Okay, got it. I thought you were part of the current cohort and I was like, you have to be in Montreal to attend the classes and I was like, okay, no.
Fair enough. It's been a long time for me. It was hard for me to track which part is it. I would like with your independent study, I think it should be a smooth climb and if you need any help with review of your work that is being done, I would be happy to do that.
And I think it should be fine. You guys should be able to handle it easily. And Fatih is an expert on that, so we just got to follow his guidance on this, and hopefully everything goes right, yeah. Yeah, that's true. So who all have you connected to before? They were also in retail?
He's in Canadian Tire, right?
I'm trying to connect with Sophie. Do you know Sophie? No. Okay. Not sure. Yeah, but yeah, so yeah, I mean, this is good, like, you should connect with the people and sorry there's this, like, Nehal. She is in P&G. I don't know if that company might be useful for you. That's also in retail, but it's part of CPG.
I think there are a lot of people from MMA and different retail companies. I think you will be able to get a few. Yeah, for sure. Best of luck and we'll talk later. Yeah, we'll talk later. Thank you. No worries. Bye.
