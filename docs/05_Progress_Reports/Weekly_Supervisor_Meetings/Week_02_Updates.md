## Key Findings Across Interviews

### 1. Universal Pain Points

#### **Single Integrated Platform Need**
- **Core Requirement:** Make forecasting and allocation truly real-time and integrated into a single source
- **Current State:** Multiple disconnected systems requiring manual reconciliation across all companies
- **Desired State:** Unified platform that eliminates manual handoffs between teams

#### **Automated Localization**
- **Store-Level Optimization:** Automatically localize assortments based on regional/store-level demand patterns
- **Cross-Border Intelligence:** Smart inventory distribution between US-Canada warehouses (INT-001)
- **Channel-Specific Allocation:** Different needs for e-commerce vs retail stores (INT-003)

#### **Intelligent Rebalancing**
- **Automated Redistribution:** Rebalance inventory with minimal (or no) manual intervention
- **Real-Time Adjustments:** Respond to demand changes without 30-120 day lag
- **Cost Optimization:** Smart routing to minimize cross-border transfer costs and tariffs

#### **Data Fragmentation Crisis**
- **Manual Work Burden:** 15-20+ hours/week spent on Excel-based analysis and data consolidation
- **Forecast Accuracy:** 60-85% accuracy across all companies due to disconnected data sources
- **Cross-Functional Silos:** Planning, merchandising, and allocation teams working in isolation

## Patterns and Insights

### 1. Industry-Specific Challenges

#### **Furniture Manufacturing (INT-001)**
- **Long Lead Times:** 1-year planning horizon creates amplified forecast errors
- **Cross-Border Operations:** US-Canada inventory redistribution adds complexity
- **Economic Sensitivity:** Need to incorporate tariff and policy changes

#### **Large-Scale Retail (INT-002)**
- **Scale Complexity:** Millions of SKUs across 10,000+ stores globally
- **Team Coordination:** Forecast fragmentation across buying, merchandising, and planning teams
- **Supplier Management:** Inconsistent lead time information and data quality

#### **Fashion Retail (INT-003)**
- **Seasonal Volatility:** Swimwear demand heavily weather-dependent
- **Channel Integration:** E-commerce and retail reconciliation challenges
- **Expansion Pressure:** Manual processes don't scale for US market expansion

### 2. Technology Gaps Identified

#### **Current State Limitations**
- **Legacy Systems:** 10-20 year old ERP systems unable to handle real-time requirements
- **Excel Dependency:** Critical business decisions still made in spreadsheets
- **Integration Barriers:** APIs fragmented or non-existent between core systems
- **Processing Delays:** Batch processing (daily/weekly) prevents real-time optimization
