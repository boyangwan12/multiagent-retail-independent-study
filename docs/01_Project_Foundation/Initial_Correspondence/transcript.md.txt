An organization that buys goods, sell goods, has logistics, has allocation needs, optimization needs AI. That you will end up seeing all of these type of use cases and so if I talk about like very generic type of process let's say that at the Outlook group. You want to manufacture things, right? You want to actually manufacture shoes the way that this process starts is with design, the ideation and the design, but not every designer or the product idea would end up being in a store.
Speaker
What would you you.
Speaker 1
Would do is you would need to do some tests and then based on similar products that you already sell in the market, you want to understand if this product is going to be successful, right? And that is going to be demand for. Testing. So let's say 10 months, even 12 months before the season starts, you do some sort of demand forecasting to say if I have a product like this with these characters text. For sure it could be like the. How is this sold? You know, what are the material? You know, what is the style and what's the the color and those type of things. But it could be anything and any type of product we can't really generalize this. And if I know that I'm going to be selling this many of these products, then you would decide how many of those products needs needs to be manufactured. And in which colors in which sizes and where are you going to be selling those like in which store? OK, so far. OK. Like did you follow? So yeah, the process starts from ideation design. And then I have multiple, they say ten of those designs. But I need to pick only three of them because it just doesn't make sense to manufacture everything. And you do demand forecasting to search, I think based on what I've been selling so far based on the trend in the mark. Out of those 10 products, these three look legit. They look, they're actually going to be, you know, successful in the market. And then based on that, I would say, OK, now that I know that these products are going to be successful, how many of them I need to manufacture and in which colors which which sizes and this and that and how many of them I need to send to which of the my stores. On my E com so that is like pretty much the you know, any company that has the manufacturing line and sells something has this problem to be solved.
Speaker 2
Gosh. Yeah.
Speaker
MHM.
Speaker 1
If you talk about like you know the way that this is captured in books, this is called, you know, the the planning and allocation process and in retail is called merchandise planning and allocation process. And there are three key pillars. 1 is really the demand forecasting, which is a type Time series forecasting problem of course. And then you have, OK, the assortment mix, meaning that you know which of these products and how many of these products, which colors and the sizes and these things I need to actually manufacture or I need to buy. Depending on my my business. So that's that assortment and then you get into when you get closer to the season. Meaning that you are getting closer to when you want to put it in the store. Then becomes an allocation problem. At that time you have a lot more data about. The sales about the demand and then at that moment you want to decide where exactly you should. Be. Sending this product to be sold and that is called allocation. OK, so these are like. Tricky things over here.
Speaker 2
OK, sounds sounds a lot of stuff like the entire flow from the design all the way to allocation. If you were summarized like this, what is the key problem that the example you just gave us is about?
Speaker 1
Let's go find that right. Let's instead of like, you know, relying on me. I mean, let's find out the type of problems that these clients actually have.
Speaker 2
OK, so so you'll want us because we're building like multi agent, so that definitely gonna involve multiple part of the workflow of the operation flow of retail company.
Speaker 3
Right.
Speaker 1
In its simplest form, you can think about like 3 agents in a simplest form. One agent is going to be doing the demand forecasting. Right. And anytime whenever you ask to do demand for casting, it just does demand for casting. That's one agent. The other agent is going to be OK. I want to decide based on the demand forecasting, I want to decide what would be the products I should sell. That's what that means. And the other would be OK, but how do I decide which product I should send to which store?
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 1
This is very, very high level. I mean at this level it's going to be easy to really build something. But. You know, most of these organizations that they may have troubles or problems in each of these phases like. That you can drill, you know, double click a little to really understand how they deal with these type of scenarios, how they actually do the assortment, how they do the allocation and how do they do actually the the forecasting. So you can see as three agents that you. Want. To build. But then how do you specialize these agents? Or for the the companies that you're going to be. OK, this is just from the problem point of view. Then how do we build the agent? That's the definite discussion that we will have later.
Speaker 2
You gave the example you gave us is about from design to merchandise allocation. So what I'm thinking is that we can. First, map out the workflow of all the interviewees that we going to talk to, and then we kind of identify what are, let's say 3 main problem within this generic workflow and then we build agents to solve the problem.
Speaker 1
Uh-huh. Yeah. First of all, you want to really focus on the problem itself to really understand what are the key pillars and then what are the challenges that each of these organizations they have, let me just. Presented something. You're able to see my screen.
Speaker 2
Right, yeah.
Speaker 1
OK, let me just put it here. So like a typical process in a product lifecycle, from design to client, and if you infuse AI into that process starts with design. Depending on the type of organization, for Aldo is like 18 months before the season starts. The design process starts. But that is like, really artistic creative. I mean, we're not anticipating adding any AI to this besides the design tool that you know, that's not something we want to. Say. Then you want to do some sort of a budget thing to say that like one year before the season starts. Based on the previous years, I know how many products I can actually manufacture. That's the budget that I have to manufacture. Products or to buy their products. OK, then you get to the assortment. I'm I'm going through this side of the the chart and the assortment is OK. Now I have the budget. I want to know what exactly I'm going to to be actually putting in the stores in the future. But I don't know how many of them at this point. The only thing that I know that OK out of those so many designs, I'm just going to pick these and in these colors that's going to be my mix. But how many of those I'm going to actually be. Manufacturing and that, I don't know yet. I do have a budget. I did not allocate it to that. Then you get to the pricing to say, hey, that's why itself is a different idea that's out of the scope. Let's say I'm not. They're not tackling each of these pieces in this project.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 1
Right. So the one that we're really tackling is really being able to do assortment based on the demand forecasting for now. Then the pricing would be OK, what is the fair pricing of these products that I I would know that based on my competitors based on historical data that I can actually sell these products, but. It's out of scope. Then you get to the point that OK, now that I have my assortment, I want to to decide. How many of those I need to buy again based on demand for casting? And I know that these are the products that I'm going to be manufacturing then. How many of those exactly needs to be manufactured? OK, that's the buying part. And then the manufacturing and this gets you like until, like even two months before the season starts. And almost two months before the season starts to two weeks before the season starts, that the things are going to be manufactured already, they're going to be packaged and you're going to be receiving them. So OK, now where I'm going to actually put them in which store and how many of those I need to to allocate to each of these stores and that becomes the allocation. So if you see the bigger the big rocks over here includes the assortment and the allocation really. You know, this is like, again, most of the enterprise retailers that they have a trouble around this. But again, you know you will be talking to them trying to understand their process, their challenges and based on that they can double click on any of these pieces. Typically, the preseason planning and optimization as a whole, or in other words, is merchandise. Planning and allocation and it has these these three pieces that you see at the bottom of the diagram, the demand forecasting assortment and an allocation. OK. So that's kind of like the scope. You can see these as three agents that they're going to be working together. Then once you get into the season. Then it becomes more sort of like operation. Now you want to ensure that you know you can't sell it if you're not selling what you do you. You make discounts or you transfer products between the stores, but that is also out of the scope of what you're doing, so it's really preseason. Do a demand forecasting and then based on those demand forecasting, deciding what product mix I want to sell and then saying that, OK, I'm just, I want to just allocate them to to the stores.
Speaker 2
Got it. Got it. So from a technical perspective, in this case what we would build is just a multi agent system to deal with the preseason planning and optimization. And there might be sub agents doing each part like design, budgeting, assortment, all of those. And then we use the orchestrator.
Speaker 1
Don't. Not not all of them. Not that forget about the the forget about this part. This is too many. OK, this part.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 1
These ones you you forget them for now. What you want to really focus is these these three boxes.
Speaker 2
OK. OK.
Speaker 1
OK, the design, no, the the budget thing, no, just just to like high level pieces and demand forecasting. And use that to the assortment planning and then use that to do allocation. That's it.
Speaker 2
OK, got it. Got it. So so if you were to find the beginning of this agentic system and the end of the beginning of the agentic system, what are they the beginning and the end?
Speaker 1
What do you mean by beginning of the system?
Speaker 2
So because because, like the whole agent take system we we need to like start doing something 1st and then there's a a final end goal that we're trying to achieve. So what what are they specifically in this case?
Speaker 1
Each of them, they're like agents. Each of each of these pieces, they're agents, and each one, they have their own goals. Right? So, like the goal of an allocation, planning and optimization is to ensure that. It does the best job in terms of allocating products to the different locations.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 1
You can see this has two pieces. If you already have like an agent that does demand for testing. The second piece of it becomes decision intelligence. Take a step back. No agent Kiki whatsoever. If you build this with machine learning or statistics. What would you do? You would build a time series forecasting model. OK, that time series forecasting model with. Forecast demand.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 1
Right, not that you have the demand forecasted demand, you would say, OK, I know that this product is demanded or this is not. I will pick the products that are going to be on demand, will just discard the products that I know that they are not going to be on demand, that's assortment right to say that I want to manufacture these products and I want to sell these products after all. So that's the first stage then. Based on that decision that someone manufacturers these products. The different countries then? You receive these products, know what you do. With those products? You want to send them to the stores or you want to sell them in in in ecom.
Speaker
Hmm.
Speaker 1
OK, then you say if I know at that time I can't do another demand forecasting that I know that these products that I have are going to be selling then.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 1
I will do an optimization model. What is that optimization model is like? You know, being an integer programming or mixing teacher programming type of approaches. This is purely non agentic.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 1
Right. There's nothing agenting right now, but I what? What I explained whatsoever, now we want to make this agent thing. What does that mean? It means that this demand per casing by itself. Is going to to check things is going to run. There's a loop that it just does things and it uses large language models behind the scenes. Yeah, to make the reasoning. It does use this say forecasting machine learning models, but on top of that it can add its own perspective. OK, OK. Don't get to the to the to the solution at this moment. Let's actually go see if this is actually a problem first of all.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 1
If this is something that, like if, let's say if we build this product, they're going to actually be willing to pay for it. That's the most important thing because we don't want to just do. Agent Care forsake of doing it. Right, that's we agree. We find that out. Yes, this is the problem or this part is the biggest challenge. These type of features we want to really build when you build the product. These are the type of requirements features that you want to examine. And based on that the solution would be to build these systems.
Speaker
MHM.
Speaker 1
With data like with AI, but the twist is going to be we're actually going to be doing it agentic. Because. These reasoning engines, these LMS they can orchestrate multiple things and then you. Can get better results. Got it.
Speaker 2
All. Right. Yeah, thank you for explaining. This is very clear. Yeah. And and also I really want to know the common practice to let's say, kick off a project and. The like from a project management perspective because I saw your e-mail is a well structured scope defining e-mail and then you're going to send us a kickoff document and you know, like all those standard processes for doing a project. So like, what's your expectation on project management side?
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 1
My expectation is that you guys do these type of things. I mean I'm not going to micromanage you guys. You know, you're already doing these things for me. What is important is to see real stuff. And then once we start to talk together, we can go through each of the phases of the project, right? You you decide how you manage, you know who does what. And those type of things, you are a team now. You work all together, but we should be agreeing on what needs to be done. Let's say that next time you would say that these are fine, so we have, I don't know, three months, four months. And within that the plan for the first phase to be like 3 weeks, one month. I don't know how you plan it, but you're going to need to to plan this accordingly, at least at the high level to say that we're going to spend this time to go gather. Requirements right and you want to also decide and define what exactly the output of that. Gathering is going to be that. You know requirement collection phase is going to be you're going to be talking to people, you're going to document it. So that's one output. The other thing is going to be OK. I'm going to actually build a product requirements document like PRT which is, you know, like a standard stuff and you say, OK, once we have that, then we will have a meeting, we will go through that say OK, this makes sense. The next stage would be OK, since now that we have a sort of a PRD and we we know what we want to build and what is the requirement then what would be the actually the solution to take care. The requirements so actually to build something for it. And typically you have an architecture document that talks about the solution and talks about you know how you tackle this type of thing. You know, like the PRD becomes the problem statement and then the architecture document becomes a solution approach really from the scientific academic point of view. But in industry is pretty much the same thing once you have the. Here and then you say, OK, I want to build it like this and then you come back with the document and say OK, we will review it together. We will. I will say I will give feedback. Let's do this this way or that way or. Such, and once we agree on the architecture of that then.
Speaker
Got it.
Speaker 1
So to build it so to cut it.
Speaker
Got it.
Speaker 1
And and once you cut it, then we're going to show the progress on the coding side of it. Right, showcase what's happening. What is the outcome? People have touch points. Hopefully weekly touch points to go through each of these and and. I will give you feedback, you refine and or you ask me questions or you give me feedback. They get into this discussion and then they get to the point that we see that they have something is actually working. Then after that, you're pretty much done right to say, OK, I have I had a problem. I designed a solution for it and actually implemented and this is what it is. We're not looking forward to being something that we will just sell it. That's not the point. This is more so. Of actually exercising something meaningful and and that's it for me like that is going to be the outcome of the project.
Speaker
God.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I I understand. Like we start, let's say a project brief and then form a PRD and build different apex fissure feature stories. And then we keep refining with you every week. Get gather feedback and then we put into production not production, but like development and you know like.
Speaker 1
If you want to put in production, I would said I was saying I will not say no so that you can productionized it. But I mean that could be a bit too much you know, but it it it depends what you want to do now you.
Speaker 2
I mean.
Speaker 1
Have like you know. You have a great team. You have. Hopefully some time to work on this. We can examine it to see which area you want to tackle more as well, so it's going to be a learning experience as well for you.
Speaker 2
Got you. Perfect. Do you guys have questions?
Speaker 1
Perfect. I'm on time. I have another meeting that I need to join moving forward. Do you think it's it's a good time to for this. Like we can maybe have like weekly touch points like Friday afternoons.
Speaker 2
OK. Yeah, that's that's perfect for me at least.
Speaker 3
OK.
Speaker 2
What about you guys?
Speaker 1
All right.
Speaker 2
OK. Yeah, we'll we'll negotiate and we'll talk about the time later.
Speaker 4
All good. All good. Yeah.
Speaker 1
We will, we will, I will e-mail you, maybe a propose, a couple timing and then you can pick it up. But you know Friday afternoons is going to be really convenient for me, I think and every week we can review the whole thing, the 1st next step for you would be. To create like a high level plan to say what exactly you want to do and then to put in place these milestones, then exactly you're going to be having the interviews, the outputs of the interviews, and then the PRD and then the architecture document.
Speaker 5
OK.
Speaker 1
And then when are you going to start to actually to build something? And then when you think is going to be the first version coming out? So these milestones, it should be. I'm not going to to be super religious about each of those dates, but at least to have a plan is going to definitely help.
Speaker 2
OK. Got it. Yeah, thank you. So.
Speaker 3
Yeah, he said. We we don't build agent for the sake of building agent.
Speaker 2
Yeah, but what? What? He said he, he explained. Is that OK? You have multiple individual little project, right? Like a machine learning model for demand forecasting or price forecasting. There are like many projects. And and on top of that, we can build an AI agent layer. Who can you know, either use this as a tool. That's what. That's what you said. Like why you think those things are not. Like able to be an agent agentic, maybe it's just part of the tool of the agentic system where agents can can use it. You know like. Then that tool itself it doesn't require. Agentic but like we can build a a a bigger picture where like, you know, those agents can use different tools, different mini projects and we we build all those mini projects for for those agents to use and then we we also build this different personas for for different agents and on top of that we have.
Speaker 3
Hmm.
Speaker 2
Orchestrator who orchestrated all the agent. And all the all the agents can decide what kind of tool that they can use. And yeah, like no matter what like. We're we're building, we're starting from those individual media project and we like go from there, build the AI feature and and and and and last we build the whole system. That's what I think.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Well, what I also understand is like we divided, we first like divided each like separately and then try to find the problem by the interview and then start with the like kind of like backbone stage. Like what we can do with the like machine learning and then on top of that we put the AI agents into it. To see if there is a like better result or not.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. We're going to start with those small problem that the industry has. So we can go there and you know, solve them individually or whatever and then orchestrate them together.
Speaker 4
Maybe like we can include the client as a Guild and because they also do the like. They have allocation things that they're like actually going on right now.
Speaker 2
Who?
Speaker 4
The Guild and the company I'm working with Serena.
Speaker 2
Ohh, OK, OK.
Speaker 4
MHM.
Speaker
MMM.
Speaker 2
Yeah, for sure. And yeah, like he's pretty clear about what he wants us to do. And I guess in terms of how we're going to start the project. So my idea is that we use like, be mad to do, like brainstorming first to map out some potential. Problem this industry has and then we go and use it as a guideline to talk to those people in the industries so. So the the the great thing about this is that we don't go talk to them without preparing anything, right? We know well question that we can we can ask we kind of just guess what the what the pain point they have and then let them confirm or like you know there's a list of pinpoint that we think that they potentially have. And then we talk to them and let them check the Marks and overall and after that we like. Give a whole project brief or PRD and to define like what fatigue showed as example like. But we we defined different things obviously. And then we start from there. What do you guys think?
Speaker 4
Good.
Speaker 2
Nice. Nice. So I think the key here is that we need to understand their workflow, how each company works. Like they start from what and they they like. Do you know different steps? And at the end, they want to produce some end goal or results. And we got to understand how this retail company work in order to like. Find their problem and the problem has to be generic. That's another issue they have to apply for the whole industry, not a single one company. Yeah.
Speaker 3
But The thing is that we need to find someone who is familiar with the whole process, from design to client.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 3
I mean because normally we. The people we can find is who only know part of this process. We only know design or he only know the assortment, only know the allocation, then how do we put like these pieces of information together?
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Speaker 2
You know, I don't know, maybe find a manager. Find the CEO.
Speaker 3
We need to find someone who know how to orchestrate these small pieces.
Speaker 2
I would say.
Speaker 3
And that's very hard to find.
Speaker 2
No, I I I mean let's say for my company, the business excellent team or business intelligent team, they know all the workflow. I I believe all company have that department or like some sort. Sort of. Department like that. So like usually they what they do is like they were trying to optimize the workflow or the coordination between like among all the departments. I bet there's definitely something like that. So we can talk to them and they're they are not necessarily manager of whatever department they're in. They're like, you know, just like a in House consulting team type of type of thing. That could be an option. Yeah, but but obviously finding the CEO is the best way.
Speaker 3
Only the CEO of Novartis.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
It's just old e-mail. Like all e-mail him from the teams. Oh, I have a school project. Can you give me some minutes?
Speaker 2
Do you guys have those, let's say business Intelligence department or Business Excellence department or Operation Excellent or whatever you call it, nothing like that.
Speaker 4
Have have like we have BI team but it's like they actually built it like dashboard for all of the departments but like they don't know like all of process like they know some of it because.
Speaker 2
OK, that's fair.
Speaker 4
Like. Each like individual or like kind of like specialized in some kind of like department. So it's not like always as like they know everything.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's fair.
Speaker 5
Yeah, same here. Like it's, uh, different. Like we have a. Like business excellence team, but the team like it deals with different kinds of information like we do not like for us like and the artist we do not. I mean we do sell the the. How do you call that the drops and then? But then we don't like manufacture it from this corporate side. So that's why, like, there's not exactly someone who knows the whole flow but said it's like breaking into different pieces and then yeah.
Speaker 3
And we only focus on one part of the the workflow strategies go to us. For example, can we just focus on the allocation?
Speaker 2
Uh. Honestly, I'm also confused about that part because what I what I saw was just the entire workflow retail company would have from design to to, you know, selling to a customer or maybe maybe not like there's no like marketing or like actually the actual distribution part. But you know it's a pretty big. Workflow already. So this is not. It's not like he wants. He wants us to focus on a single function of the company. He wants something bigger, like at least a multi departmental issues. That's what I understand.
Speaker 4
Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think what he said was like. Like. We put it like separate like design assortment and allocations and then we do like the result of this design impacts our assortments and the assortment result also impacts the locations. That's like how he like connected each other. But firstly you view them as like separate. Yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah. And back to the question about like how do we map the whole workflow, I would say. Maybe just like a puzzle game, we have to talk to multiple people from multiple department in the company to get a full picture, I mean. Yeah, and and and to see because because my logic is that we have to have an idea what the entire workflow look like first before we dive into those specific. Area.
Speaker 3
Does sense? Things. So you mentioned that change has that kind of team, who knows everything about the workflow? Is Branch considered a retail company?
Speaker 2
No, we're like. Where as a supplier is on the upstream. Manufacturing, yeah.
Speaker 4
And also like we have to touch based on like multiple companies, right, not right not not like just one company.
Speaker 2
Yeah, multiple, yeah.
Speaker 4
That's hard.
Speaker 2
Multiple and find something in common.
Speaker 4
Then how many like people would we have to interview?
Speaker 5
Five, he's at 5, right? I don't know.
Speaker 2
I mean, five companies, but.
Speaker 5
Oh yeah, five companies. Sorry.
Speaker 3
Five company and each company we need to interview like. 5 to 10.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Speaker 3
People so, so that will be 50 people.
Speaker 1
No.
Speaker 3
When you imagine like 10% of the people, we reach out to, you will reply to us and then we need to reach out to 500 people.
Speaker 4
And also they're going to take some time to actually reply our message, so. It will be like a whole lot of process.
Speaker 5
I guess two months, I'll, I guess we spent two months going back and forth with the same thing so.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that that's why I suggested that we go with the brainstorming document first. At least we have something at hand and we just the only thing we need to do is just to confirm with them. The problem they actually have.
Speaker 1
Much alright, have a great rest of your week and great weekend. Take care. Bye.
Speaker 4
Thank you so.
Speaker 2
Much you too.
Speaker 4
For now, you too. Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker
Bye bye.
Speaker 2
Stay.
Speaker 4
JT I think I got like I got the the big picture of it. I think he's clear. Basically, he's really clear.
Speaker 2
******* Zinta call this.
Speaker
What are you?
Speaker 5
It's better than what I thought. So I mean, like, he opened the puzzle for us to solve it in a way that we like it. So I think it's better than what I thought. And it's actually up to us how do we want to look at it. So nothing too complex or. Complicated for now. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 6
Bro, I got lost bro.
Speaker 5
And you ran and you and you were the first one. You ran away from this booking.
Speaker
Well.
Speaker 2
Hurry, what do you? Think.
Speaker 3
You muted? Yeah. He's talking about like we.
Speaker 5
You mute it.
Speaker 3
We. Cannot like. Build a agent for the sake of build a agent. So like we need to find. Like. The necessity of building this AI agent. So where do you see this necessity? I think like he mentioned that the AI, the large language model is to help us to orchestrate each part together to make it better. But I don't see any like point where this orchestration. That make things better because I think they're quite separate.
Speaker 2
I mean like it, it really depends how we define the whole structure. And I mean agentic AI. I guess the the best thing, the best part of it is that it can go back and it can reflex. It, can orchestrate things, coordinate things with reasoning. So you don't necessarily need to. Contact the whole workflow. You can, you know, like get sidetracked or go back to the the other agent to do some. Let's say if let's say the allocation is not good enough then it can go back to the design part for example, so it just. We'll figure it. Out there is definitely something that we can. Take advantage of the whole agent. Take ideas. But for now, like I don't know, like on the side, I I don't know.
Speaker 3
For now, for now I only see the necessity of using a agent for the product development, but. Like for the product development itself, we can use the agent. For example, we can use the bman workflow. But.
Speaker 6
Be mad.
Speaker 3
But like but like this like the whole. Process as he mentioned from design to client, how can we deploy agent AI to this process? And I'm still like not very sure.
Speaker 2
But, but let me ask you this, do you think bmat is useful? Why it is useful?
Speaker 3
Is useful for the. Or the like. Development of this whole project.
Speaker 2
But why? Why is good for development? You can also just have a a standard workflow starting from, you know, writing PRD all the way to the to the last step. But like yeah.
Speaker 3
I mean. What I mean is that. Using vmat workflow to develop this project. It's useful because it can help us to write PRD. It can help us to be more structured. I mean. How to deploy AI agent to? The. To to this like. Workflow. I mean from design to client. How to do that is is like it's something I don't how to do.
Speaker 2
I mean, these two, these two are pretty similar. Let's say we want to develop a software versus we want to start from design to sell shoes this. Who processes are pretty similar, right? So we have a genetic system for software development where we start from writing project, brief, brainstorming, and then all the way to Q8 testing the whole workflow, right. And then the minimap method, the beauty of it is that it gives you multiple agents that you can call. At a random time that's for user on the user's perspective. So you can do whatever that you need and you can just call that agent. And you don't need to go through the standard workflow. You know all the time and the same thing for. For the for this proposal as well, like we have multiple agents dealing with different little mini project for example like allocation planning, agent, pricing, forecasting agent. And whatever and user can just. I don't know, like call the call those agent at a random time to do certain tasks and we can also like be mad. There's like standard workflow we can build standard workflow or like orchestration tool or even make the agents have memories and reasoning capability to make decisions to. To see like OK, next time, next step. Should I do allocation forecasting or price forecasting, right? Like there are some? Steps that we can add some decision making or like agentic features on it, and to be honest like as well fatigue said we're we're just using this project project to get practice to like practice the the whole development or idea generations or all the way to the. Final product, we want to get used to this, so that's that's what I think.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I what I mean is that or? The time series forecasting you don't need an agent or assortment, you don't need an agent. They are quite. You can just use the simple machine learning model to do that. Then why do we need a multi agent system?
Speaker 2
That's something we need to figure out.
Speaker 4
OK. Yeah, I'll ask my company actually, because they have like manufacturing and all the like to the end of.
Speaker 3
Do you? Do you have any connection in South Korea? Like, do you have any relative in Samsung, I believe Samsung.
Speaker 4
Oh.
Speaker 3
Must have some retail department.
Speaker 4
I think I think the, yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Do you have any relationship?
Speaker 2
I mean on. All the Koreans work for Samsung anyway.
Speaker 3
We need your.
Speaker 2
OK.
Speaker 3
Yeah, we need to leverage that relationship.
Speaker 4
Yeah, I'll try to build the connection, but it will. It will take, it will take time.
Speaker 2
Is your company retail?
Speaker 4
It's manufacturing, but it does. It does have like retail also. But I I think like. It's not actually like retail retail, but it's like. Other other like companies are retail like clients are retailing it.
Speaker 5
Retail should be something like.
Speaker 4
Like, yeah, so, so those are my our clients like Nike, SNS, like fanatics.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Then your manufacturer just like me.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's not like real retail.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah. And and I think retail and we can look up the definition, but from my mind, retail is more like consumer goods, not even but fatigue.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 3
But he just said, like every company like that sells something that can be counted as retail company.
Speaker 2
Then all companies are ******* retail companies, yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah, that's why, yeah.
Speaker 3
In his definition, every company is a retail company.
Speaker 4
Yeah. Yeah, it's every every company. Yes.
Speaker 5
Yeah, every company that sells something like in his definition. Is a retail company.
Speaker 3
Yeah. So I guess brands can be counted as a retail company.
Speaker 4
Yeah, I think so because.
Speaker 2
Which one?
Speaker 3
French.
Speaker 2
No, no, we're B2B. We're we're we're sell to business, not customer. Retail has to be customers.
Speaker 5
Yeah, same here for Novartis as well.
Speaker 3
No, but but fatigue doesn't like define retail as that. So, so fatigue scope is much wider than we thought. Yeah, like if they if you guys do allocation, then it's retail.
Speaker 1
No, no, I don't think so.
Speaker 2
No, but I don't think this is good for our project anyway, because we want to narrow down the scope.
Speaker 3
But.
Speaker 2
Like we don't want a brass globe and all companies are different. How are we going to find the common ground? Like we want like, Nike, Adidas, lululemon, like all those similar goods. So they have the same problem that we can solve not like trench who manufacture ******* electricity stuff and and you know, you know.
Speaker 3
But but The thing is that. Is this kind of workflow confidential? For example, if you reach out to Lululemon CEO, you want to ask how they orchestrate each department, how they operate? Is that confidential?
Speaker 5
I think yeah, kind of 5050 like it depends on what you define as confidential. What you would want to see, right.
Speaker
Hmm.
Speaker 2
I think departmental connections probably confidential, but there that that's that's the the benefit of narrowing down the scope to a specific. Let's say close selling retail so they they have the end goal the same which is selling their clothes to the customer and they have the starting point the same as well. So it's like their their work workflow probably the same but they have different. Departmental orchestration. That part probably comes with.
Speaker 4
Just interview for tea.
Speaker 3
He said, like Aldo is not shouldn't be our list. Ohh then.
Speaker 5
He said that like when he replied to our first e-mail.
Speaker 4
That sucks.
Speaker 2
Yeah. It's fine. I I think we'll, we'll. We'll manage this. We'll manage to find all the people to interview with.
Speaker 3
Like. I still want to make this point, so can we just narrow down? You one department because within the department there's still something that needs someone to orchestrate, to coordinate with different team. So can we only focus on one part of his workflow?
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 3
For example, allocation allocation itself is a. Problem. It also needs some coordination, cooperation, orchestration.
Speaker 2
Yes, yes.
Speaker 3
So can we just narrow down to allocation or some other?
Speaker 4
Yeah, let's start from there.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I think we can do. That too. Yeah, that, that's what I ask during the meeting. But he didn't really answer my question. I think I think we can focus on either the big picture of how a big company operate and we solve. We build agents for each department or we we solve individual problem for a specific department to solve a big problem and we divide it into different small parts. As agents. Honestly, I think the. Solving one big problem for the one single department is easier for us.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I think so, I agree.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Speaker 3
Yeah, and the interviewer. We need to find is like, and the interviewee we do find is much easier.
Speaker 2
Yeah, that's a good point, yeah.
Speaker 5
Because we have a constrained segment or group of people, we would want to target. So I agree with that.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I think we still need to talk to him to make sure though. Because what he presented today, I'm not sure if that's the responsibility for one single department or the whole company.
Speaker 3
And also another big problem is that where do?
Speaker 4
We get the data.
Speaker 3
Do we just mark the data? We use the mock data?
Speaker 2
Yeah, I guess.
Speaker 5
Synthetic data, do you? Mean.
Speaker 3
Yeah.
Speaker 2
Right. Yeah. I think we can do that. Just treat them as independent. Little study that little project that we used to do. We download data online to solve like let's say a demand forecasting whatever because still like the focus is. The AI part, even for they didn't see it like that, but that's how we defined it at first. Yeah. The way I think about the whole thing right now is that we do multiple small project like what we used to do. At school and then on top of it, we build AI system to orchestrate those little project.
Speaker 3
And we like, can we take a step back like? Can we think about the question why do we need the orchestration? Is it because different part is interconnected with different part so this part? What this part output will affect what another part behave? Though, is it because of that? So we need some orchestration.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 4
I think all of that the person. That division that he actually mentioned is or like interconnected like the result of previous actually impacts the like all and all locations. Because like like the product that we actually pick, then it's also linked with the allocation as something like that, right? Yeah.
Speaker 3
So we need to find the problem that it has many subsections that are interconnected.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Speaker
Yes. Yes.
Speaker 3
Hmm.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I would say let's say in one department, there are multiple people. They have division of Labor, they do different things. They they are designed to do a specific task, but among them they still need to communicate. Right. Like one. Yeah, right. So that's the point of agent take system. They can talk. But like, what do they talk or what's the benefit from the communication are defined by us. But that's the idea.
Speaker 3
So traditionally, if we don't have the AI agent. How do they communicate? And then if we have this agent, how do we improve their communication process? Is that is that a question we need to think about?
Speaker 2
Yeah, maybe the traditional approach, which let's say we build a tool for a specific problem, the mind forecasting, right, and then the end user in whatever department they're in, they would only use this tool to solve one problem. But now we want to build an agentic. System. Who can orchestrate itself to do multiple things at once? It will just do. You know from design to allocation like what fatigue said at once. That's I think that's the also the big, OK.
Speaker 3
OK, so to sum it up, if we want to like build an agentic AI workflow, there should be a workflow.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 3
Right. There should be a traditional workflow and then once we find that traditional workflow, we can use a agent to improve that workflow, right? Is that correct?
Speaker 2
I think so, yeah. Because. Let's say within a single department. There are multiple employees and each employee has different tasks. And there should be a workflow within the department to coordinate this real people. Real employees. That's how the AI system going to work.
Speaker
Yes. Yes.
Speaker 2
You.
Speaker 3
Yes, yes.
Speaker 2
Yeah. It just we narrowed it down not from a company operational perspective. We narrowed down to a departmental operational perspective. So it would be easier and to be honest, it's better because.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 3
Yes.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I think it's better and it's. Easier.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. Then. Everything is clear right now. What's the next step?
Speaker 2
So what fatigue said was we got to come up with a plan like what we did for Capstone project. We define the milestones we define like what we going to do, who's going to be what position or whatever. Honestly, maybe we don't even need that division of Labor, whatever, but we need a plan to present it to fatigue. So.
Speaker 3
Yeah.
Speaker 2
What I'm thinking is that we just. Use bmat to make the plan because it has the feature to do it when you.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds good. Sounds.
Speaker 2
Good. So what I'm thinking is that we cuz have you guys tried bmat already or no? Hurry. Did you have you tried it?
Speaker 3
I talked to the analyst called called what a female analyst. Yeah, Mary.
Speaker 2
Mary.
Speaker 3
Married. It's good for the brainstorm, but you need to know your what your question is what your problem is.
Speaker 2
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So what, what I'm thinking is that we I on board you guys on being mad method, it could be used for for any aspect of of your work of your life of this project. So it could be useful. So we onboard this and after that we individually use this tool to you know just. Just brainstorm it with Mary or whatever, and we we gather the idea together and we make the the plan. And we start from there.
Speaker 6
We need a tutorial of the be mad.
Speaker 2
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let let. Let's do this. So we schedule a meeting, and I'm gonna introduce you to to this tool from a technical perspective like how how you guys can actually use it instead of just bragging about it. OK and then. And I'll send you tutorials that you can watch later and after that you guys going to use it and talk to Mary. After talking to Mary, we we have another meeting and then we gather the ideas together and we submit the we submit the plan to fatigue and we start working.
Speaker 3
Dave wants to say something and I just cut him. In half.
Speaker 2
No, no. Yeah.
Speaker 5
Who wanted to say something?
Speaker 2
What do you guys think?
Speaker 5
Yeah, we can just.
Speaker 3
I think it's good. I think it's good.
Speaker 2
Yeah. OK, that's great. So also about the the team for, for and a team perspective, I don't think we need to divide any position for for us like, oh, you're the. Modeler. You're the architect. Whatever. Because we might. We'll do everything for us anyway. So, like, Bmet is a manager. Bmet is the architect. Is the analyst. It has all the roles. So what we need to do our position will be met. User. That's it. And obviously we cannot tell this to fatigue, but. This is how it's gonna be. And he's not gonna micromanage us anyway, so we're good. Harry is frozen.
Speaker 3
I was. I was checking checking. With peace.
Speaker 4
I thought it was it was life.
Speaker 2
Yeah. So are we good. So I'll deal with the e-mail, e-mail thing for sure. And later on we can.
Speaker 4
Hmm, yeah, we we first do the high level and then we can like go. Even deep.
Speaker 3
Yeah. Jay, do you talk to Samsung CEO?
Speaker 4
Yeah, sure. And phone call.
Speaker 3
I'll have a. Yeah, yeah. Let us know.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 5
But yeah, I wanted to add something. So when are we submitting the form?
Speaker 2
Yeah. After this talk, we have a clear understanding. I think we can. I'll do it. Don't worry about it. It's just a formality thing and I'll just have a conversation with Mary and Mary. We'll figure out and I'll just submit it. Don't worry. And. But we do need an internal timeline though, let's say. What? OK. How available are you guys going to be for this project? Like what's the internship plan for the whole semester?
Speaker 3
I need to work on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and then the rest of the time I'm free.
Speaker 2
No overtime.
Speaker 3
I guess so.
Speaker 2
I don't believe you.
Speaker 5
Yeah, I don't believe you as well. Last time we have a a party with the Latino people and then he brought his laptop to the party and he was working there.
Speaker 3
Yeah, that was when I was the most busy. Yeah, that was when I was super busy. But after that, I'm quite OK, because everything is stable right now. Models are running smoothly. Yeah.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Speaker 2
Great. Great.
Speaker 3
Don't need to debug anything.
Speaker 2
Yeah. OK. So Thursday, no. Wednesday. Thursday, Friday. You were in office?
Speaker 4
That's great. That's great.
Speaker 3
Yeah.
Speaker 2
OK. What about you guys?
Speaker 5
So for me, I'm mostly free. I think I'll sign up for a a French course, so I'm not sure. Maybe something online, but I'm mostly free, but for I don't want to work on weekends, so please no meetings on Saturdays or Sundays. Evening. And then, yeah, mostly free. If Harry is going to work and I don't know, Jay and Boyang as well. So maybe we can do Monday or Tuesday for meetings. And then tea will be Friday because he said Friday afternoon would be OK for him. So I'm not sure.
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah.
Speaker 4
For me, I'm working on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But I I can. I'm I might be able to arrange like for like maybe like Tuesday I work in the morning and then afternoon on Thursday. So I leave like Tuesday afternoon blank for this.
Speaker 3
Hmm.
Speaker 4
So I would like I will talk to my manager and try to like kind of. Make a space on yeah on Monday between on Monday and Wednesday.
Speaker 5
Accommodate.
Speaker
OK.
Speaker 4
So, Henry, you said Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, right? So basically we need a time on Monday and. Tuesday, right? Yeah. OK, OK, I'll I'll try to make one, yeah.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Speaker 7
To.
Speaker 5
Both.
Speaker
Uh.
Speaker 7
Since that, uh, I don't have uh. I don't have internship from next week, but I'm not sure from September.
Speaker 2
Wait, so you you're finishing up your internship? And you're not going to do part time for the same company anymore.
Speaker 7
Uh, they don't have the part time chance for. Me. So I'm probably gonna go for another company.
Speaker 2
Got it, got it. OK. Sure. So my schedule will be very, very flexible, even if I'm at work, I can still have meeting with you guys. So don't worry. Don't worry about me. And I would say we don't need, we don't even need to have the all those meetings.
Speaker 7
We can talk in WeChat.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Speaker 2
Yeah, we'll talk in WeChat.
Speaker 4
Good, good translator as well.
Speaker 2
Yeah, and and and I would say like with document and and the biggest advantage of being met is producing documentations. So like. Let's say we do brainstorming individually, and we all come up with a document, right? And then we we just combine all this document and let it to form a big one. Or, you know, one single document. So those type of communication usually are done by having shift on the meetings. But now we can just communicate with all those documents. But that that also applied for other processes going on so. Meeting. I don't. I don't even worry about it. So I I asked that question. Just wanna ask you guys like how available you are, if you're gonna work overtime like hungry at 724, seven or like you're you know you're good so.
Speaker 3
Yeah.
Speaker 2
I guess yeah, we're good.
Speaker 4
Yeah, we're good. I'll let you guys see Ethan. Oh, sure.
Speaker 5
What's he? What's he doing?
Speaker 4
Why is he playing? Why is he playing?
Speaker 3
He is talking to his manager. I'm sorry. I didn't buy this stock.
Speaker 2
Liar. So do you win some earlier? I don't know. How to say in English?
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Speaker 2
OK, so next meeting? For bmat. When do you guys have time?
Speaker 5
Next, let me check my calendar.
Speaker 3
Saturday. Not available for. For, for for you know. Ohh.
Speaker 5
Saturday and Sunday. No work. Guys, please. No meetings, no work, no nothing. Let me check.
Speaker 2
Wait, logistically, when is this independent study should be start.
Speaker 5
I think September.
Speaker
1st.
Speaker 3
Do we need to like submit the form?
Speaker 5
Yeah, we need to. Through the.
Speaker 3
What? What do we put it in? What do we?
Speaker 4
Put in there is a form like the topic and the signature that we have to put it in and I think it's due before the like the deadline of the like drop drop deadline.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Speaker 2
What? When is it? Oh, OK.
Speaker 5
Yeah. Probably next week I think or it's the first or second week of September. But yeah, we also he will take care of that so.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.
Speaker 2
Yeah, I'll take care of it. I'll do it tomorrow.
Speaker 3
But but everyone of us should submit.
Speaker 5
Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 4
But the content can be the same. Yeah. Yeah, it should be the same. It should be the same, just the different name and signature. Yeah. OK, OK, OK.
Speaker 5
Yeah, the call. Content should be.
Speaker 3
Thanks. Have you guys registered for the for the language test because we need the English language test to apply for the IELTS. Yeah.
Speaker 5
Yeah. No, no, stop it.
Speaker 3
Where their well, with their aisles or or some other.
Speaker 2
****.
Speaker 5
CELPIP cell pit. That one is like I I heard from Juan and that one is way more easier than IELTS and then in terms of like cost as well. So yeah, yeah, it's not expensive as aisles, but yeah.
Speaker 4
Oh, Louis.
Speaker 3
But I don't want to. I want to talk to someone like. In front of me. Do you know what I mean? I've heard that.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Speaker 3
Another one you talked about, you just talked to the machine.
Speaker 5
Yeah. Like toppling.
Speaker 3
It's it's very weird. Like I don't like the thoughtful oral test, OK?
Speaker 2
That's what I did.
Speaker 5
That's what I did as well. I I like. I really like it because like, it's only a question and you don't need to answer things like separately or additionally just as IELTS.
Speaker 2
No stress.
Speaker 4
I think I'm going to take the other one.
Speaker
Yeah.
Speaker 2
Why do we need the? When do we need this? Let's say if we apply it in January.
Speaker 4
As soon as possible.
Speaker 5
Yeah. But the latest would be the number.
Speaker 4
Yeah.
Speaker 2
What?
Speaker 5
The latest, like the latest you can apply for exam will be December. If you want to start your application for PWP.
Speaker 3
But is it hard to get a position like for the exam for the language test?
Speaker 4
No, no, no, it's it's, it's easy and and also the grade comes out like within like 3 days.
Speaker 5
No. Yes.
Speaker 3
OK, that's good.
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Speaker 2
And do we need a specifics to score or?
Speaker 5
Yeah.
Speaker 2
The the the more. The better or it just we have to just pass?
Speaker 5
I think.
Speaker 3
Sticks for the IELTS.
Speaker 4
Yeah. But if you're applying for the like the PR, than higher grade is better.
Speaker 3
Yeah, I think it's.
Speaker 5
I think benchmark is B2. If you do see one that would be awesome.
Speaker 3
Yeah. I think for the listening it should be. .5 and for the writing it should be 7.5 and I mean I mean it's for the PR and for the for the oral it's 7.5 for the rating it's five, it's 8.5.
Speaker 4
Yeah. So it should be like. Run average 8. You have like 1 tier one to be in Tier 1.
Speaker 2
But for PWP it is just bridging.
Speaker 4
6 is 6.
Speaker 3
It's only 6.
Speaker 4
So you can just like ******** it and get 6.
Speaker 2
Good, good.
Speaker 5
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean like. Just pass it like without studying man. It's just an English English test.
Speaker 4
Yeah, but if you don't want to take like one more time because it's quite expensive, so if you want to do the one shot 1 kill then just for higher grade.
Speaker 5
That's only like 2. 200 and something I guess.
Speaker 6
NIA NIA Tao.
Speaker 2
And and and for insurance. How did you guys figure out the refund?
Speaker 5
No, I'll just.
Speaker 3
We need all of our supply for their. Graduation. Yeah, and.
Speaker 5
I'll just keep it.
Speaker 2
I'll just keep at this point what the fund.
Speaker 5
Yeah. At this point of the game, I'll just keep it. I'm not going to deal with any like additional things with my kills. I'll just keep it.
Speaker 4
Transformer.
Speaker 2
OK. What are other things? Insurance. English test. What else? That we need to do this semester.
Speaker 5
Nothing else.
Speaker 4
There were fatigue.
Speaker 2
Have you guys figured out, like let's say, between your grades come out and the application date? Like dot period.
Speaker 3
So so after your final grades come out, you'll get a letter to confirm that you have graduated from this university, and then you use this letter to apply for the PWP. And after you submit it, you can start to work legally.
Speaker 2
Yeah. OK. So what about, let's say the semester ends around December, December. What like 18th and then the grade, let's say come? Out. Comes out around January something, then what's?
Speaker 4
We can ask for tea that that we want the grade like early as possible. Then he can he might like. Put the grade early. What? Yeah. Really.
Speaker 5
Are you sure?
Speaker 3
I don't know. We can just ask there should. Be a range. There should be a range of times they can. They can put on our braid. We can ask Patty to, like, put it in the earliest time as he can, yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 6
Bro, I know like Richard is going to finish his independent project by October. So, but he's going to give him his grades at the end of October.
Speaker 2
Why?
Speaker 6
Because he said he's going to have a contract with the company, so he have to be here and he has no time to work on the independent study. So that's why he started already. He's already started.
Speaker 2
Like full time.
Speaker 4
But.
Speaker 6
Contract I think.
Speaker 2
OK. I didn't know if that's that's possible. I'll do full time if I could.
Speaker 4
But I think like we can't, we cannot get the PGP like before like our stated like program and it's I don't know. Like that's possible.
Speaker 2
Oh yeah, I mean ah.
Speaker 5
Yeah. So still still wreck regular plan having everything done by December.
Speaker 3
So hopefully we can get our letter of graduation before before the Christmas.
Speaker 4
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 3
And then we we apply for it. I'll apply for the PWP and then we can go out of the country in 90 days.
Speaker 2
Wait, wait. So let's say if the grades come out, comes out in January, are we able to travel during Christmas?
Speaker 5
Yeah, why not.
Speaker 3
Yes you can.
Speaker 6
Yes.
Speaker 5
Why not?
Speaker 2
So what?
Speaker 3
90 day after 90 day, 90 day after your final grades come out.
Speaker 2
No before before.
Speaker 3
It's a it's a. Before you can go anywhere.
Speaker 4
Oh, OK. And also our like study permit end date is like March if we are extended?
Speaker 3
But but that doesn't matter. They they need to look at when is your final grades coming up.
Speaker 2
OK, OK. So are there any periods that we cannot travel?
Speaker 3
90 day after the. After 90 day, when you like, get your prey.
Speaker 2
Yeah. So before, before.
Speaker 3
After that.
Speaker 2
That we we are we're all good.
Speaker 3
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2
OK, so I can travel ****. I'll plan my Christmas trip.
Speaker 5
I heard something different that if you have the visitor visa, you can just. And come back, but it cannot come back.
Speaker 2
I have the visitor.
Speaker 3
But you cannot come back to work.
Speaker 5
I heard that you can have the you know the extension letter from the IRC after you submit the PWP you can use that to stay here legally.
Speaker 3
You can stay here legally, but you cannot work legally.
Speaker 5
