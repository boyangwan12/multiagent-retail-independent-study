# PROJECT BRIEF

## Multi-Agent System for Retail Operations: Demand Forecasting, Assortment & Allocation Optimization

---

### **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Project Title:** Practical Multi-Agent System for Retail Operations Management  
**Duration:** September 1 - December 7, 2025 (14 weeks)  
**Team:** Boyang Wan, Henry Tang, Yina Liang Li, Jintao Li  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Fatih Nayebi, McGill Desautels Faculty of Management

### **PROJECT PURPOSE & OBJECTIVES**

**Primary Goal:** Develop a credible MVP multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized AI agents for retail pre-season planning and optimization, grounded in real industry requirements discovered through structured interviews.

**Core Business Problem:** Retail organizations struggle with coordinating complex workflows across demand forecasting, assortment planning, and allocation optimization, leading to suboptimal inventory decisions and revenue loss.

**Key Objectives:**
1. **Discovery & Validation:** Conduct â‰¥5 structured interviews with retail professionals to surface real workflows, pain points, and requirements
2. **System Architecture:** Design orchestrator-based multi-agent architecture for pre-season retail planning
3. **MVP Development:** Build functional system using agent frameworks (OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK)
4. **Evaluation & Proof:** Demonstrate system usefulness and reliability through rigorous testing

### **PROJECT SCOPE & DELIVERABLES**

**In Scope - Three Core Agents:**
- **Demand Forecasting Agent:** Time-series forecasting with LLM reasoning capabilities
- **Assortment Planning Agent:** Product mix optimization based on forecasted demand
- **Allocation Planning Agent:** Store/channel allocation optimization

**Key Deliverables:**
1. **Interview Guide + Consent Forms** (Week 2)
2. **Evidence Pack** - De-identified, coded interview findings (Week 5)
3. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - Grounded in interview insights (Week 6)
4. **System Architecture Document** (Week 8)
5. **MVP Implementation** - Functional multi-agent system (Week 12)
6. **Evaluation Results** - Performance metrics and validation (Week 13)
7. **Final Demo + Technical Report** (Week 14)

**Out of Scope:**
- Design phase, budgeting, pricing optimization
- In-season management (markdowns, transfers, promotions)
- Proprietary data access or trade secrets

### **TARGET STAKEHOLDERS**

**Primary Users:** Retail planning managers, merchandise planners, allocation analysts  
**Interview Targets:** Mid-to-large retail companies (clothing, consumer goods, electronics)  
**Business Value:** Improved planning accuracy, reduced inventory waste, optimized allocation decisions

### **TECHNICAL APPROACH**

**Architecture Pattern:** Orchestrator-coordinated specialized agents  
**Frameworks:** OpenAI Agents SDK, Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)  
**Data Strategy:** Synthetic/open datasets, no confidential information  
**Integration Points:** Tool APIs for data access, machine learning model integration  
**Safety Measures:** Guardrails, evaluation harness, error handling

**Differentiation from Traditional ML:** 
- LLM-powered reasoning and orchestration capabilities
- Dynamic agent coordination vs. static pipeline
- Adaptive workflow management based on intermediate results

### **SUCCESS METRICS & EVALUATION**

**Functional Metrics:**
- System successfully completes end-to-end planning workflow
- Agents demonstrate coordinated decision-making
- Output quality meets baseline accuracy thresholds

**Business Validation:**
- Interview findings validate problem significance
- PRD reflects genuine industry requirements
- MVP addresses identified pain points

**Technical Excellence:**
- Clean, documented, testable codebase
- Proper agent framework integration
- Comprehensive evaluation methodology

### **PROJECT TIMELINE & MILESTONES**

**Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements (Weeks 1-6)**
- Week 1-2: Interview guide development, ethics approval
- Week 3-5: Conduct retail professional interviews
- Week 6: Complete PRD based on findings

**Phase 2: Architecture & Design (Weeks 7-8)**
- Week 7-8: System architecture design and documentation

**Phase 3: Development & Implementation (Weeks 9-12)**
- Week 9-11: MVP development and agent integration
- Week 12: System integration and initial testing

**Phase 4: Validation & Delivery (Weeks 13-14)**
- Week 13: Evaluation and performance analysis
- Week 14: Final demo preparation and technical report

### **RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS**

**Team Commitment:** 4 team members, ~10-15 hours/week per person  
**Supervision:** Weekly 30-minute check-ins with Dr. Nayebi (Fridays)  
**Technology Stack:** Agent development frameworks, cloud computing resources  
**Data Access:** Public/synthetic datasets, interview transcripts (anonymized)

### **RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION**

**High-Risk Areas:**
- **Interview Access:** Difficulty reaching retail professionals
  - *Mitigation:* Leverage team networks, professional outreach, academic partnerships
- **Technical Complexity:** Agent framework integration challenges  
  - *Mitigation:* Start with simple implementations, iterative development
- **Scope Creep:** Expanding beyond core three agents  
  - *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to defined scope boundaries

**Medium-Risk Areas:**
- Data quality limitations with synthetic datasets
- Team coordination across different schedules
- Timeline pressure for comprehensive deliverables

### **CONSTRAINTS & BOUNDARIES**

**Ethical Constraints:** IRB approval required, no PII collection, proper consent procedures  
**IP Ownership:** Students retain full ownership of code and documentation  
**Confidentiality:** No proprietary business data, no external LLM uploads of sensitive content  
**Academic Standards:** Results-first approach, rigorous methodology, comprehensive documentation

### **PROJECT GOVERNANCE**

**Decision Framework:** Team consensus with supervisor guidance  
**Progress Tracking:** Weekly milestone reviews, artifact-based assessment  
**Quality Standards:** Peer review, supervisor feedback integration  
**Communication:** Weekly team meetings, formal supervisor check-ins
