This project develops a multi-agent AI system for retail pre-season planning, addressing the complex coordination challenges in demand forecasting, assortment planning, and allocation optimization. Through structured interviews with retail professionals, we'll identify real industry pain points and build specialized AI agents that collaborate via an orchestrator to streamline decision-making processes that traditionally require manual coordination across multiple departments and stakeholders.
