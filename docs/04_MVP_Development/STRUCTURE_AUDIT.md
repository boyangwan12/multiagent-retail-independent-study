## Key Patterns & Standards

### Version Numbering

**Semantic Versioning:**
- `v1.0` - Initial complete draft
- `v1.1, v1.2` - Minor updates and refinements
- `v2.0` - Major revisions or scope changes
- `v3.0` - Significant architectural changes

**Current State:** All planning docs at v3.2 (stable, implementation-ready)

### Document Sections (Common Patterns)

**All Planning Documents Include:**
- Version number and date in header
- Status (Draft, Review, Approved)
- Table of contents (for long docs)
- Related documents section at bottom
- Document owner

**All Implementation Documents Include:**
- Phase name and number
- Agent assignment
- Status tracking
- Timestamps

### File Naming Conventions

**Planning:**
- `{document_type}_v{version}.md`
- Example: `product_brief_v3.2.md`

**Implementation:**
- `{document_type}.md` (no version - evolves with phase)
- Example: `implementation_plan.md`

**Research:**
- `{Topic}_{Type}_Research.md`
- Example: `OpenAI_Agents_SDK_Retail_PoC_Research.md`

## What Works Well (Keep in Template)

### Planning Phase

1. **Product Brief + Operational Workflow Split**
   - Product brief = vision and features
   - Operational workflow = concrete examples
   - Works well as separate documents

2. **Version Progression**
   - v1.1 → v2.1 → v3.1 → v3.2
   - Shows iterative refinement
   - Archive preserves history

3. **Comprehensive PRD**
   - 1,895 lines with 15-20 user stories
   - Functional + non-functional requirements
   - Acceptance criteria by workflow
   - Success metrics clearly defined

4. **Detailed Data Specification**
   - 961 lines with complete data dictionary
   - Sample data for 3 scenarios
   - Validation rules (6 types, 24 rules)
   - CSV formats specified

5. **Research Folder**
   - Separate from core planning docs
   - Captures decision rationale
   - Free-form format works well

### Implementation Phase

1. **4-Document Pattern Per Phase**
   - Implementation plan (tasks + timeline)
   - Technical decisions (design choices)
   - Checklist (granular tracking)
   - Retrospective (lessons learned)
   - Clean and consistent

2. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**
   - Single comprehensive guide
   - Daily workflows with checklists
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Quick reference cheat sheet
   - Very practical and actionable

3. **Phase Isolation**
   - Complete one phase before starting next
   - Retrospectives feed forward
   - Clear phase boundaries

---

## Areas for Improvement (Consider in Template)

### Planning Phase

1. **Missing: Planning Retrospective**
   - No retrospective after planning phase complete
   - Could capture what worked/didn't work in planning
   - Would inform next project's planning

2. **Archive Location**
   - Archive folder at root level
   - Could be inside `planning/archive/` instead
   - More consistent with folder structure

### Implementation Phase

1. **Empty Phase Folders**
   - Phase 2-4 have empty placeholder files
   - Could just create folders without files
   - Create files when phase actually starts

2. **Template Reference**
   - Guide mentions templates but they're in separate repo
   - Could include inline examples in guide itself

## Template Abstraction Recommendations

### Must Include in Template

1. **Planning Phase:**
   - Product brief template (based on v3.2)
   - Operational workflow template
   - Technical architecture template
   - Frontend spec template
   - Data specification template
   - PRD template (comprehensive structure)
   - PLANNING_GUIDE.md

2. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Implementation plan template
   - Technical decisions template
   - Checklist template
   - Retrospective template
   - IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

3. **Guides:**
   - Keep both PLANNING_GUIDE and IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE
   - No additional READMEs needed

### Optional in Template

1. **Research folder structure**
   - Include with README explaining purpose
   - No specific template (free-form)

2. **Archive folder**
   - Include as empty folder with README
   - Explain versioning convention

3. **Main README.md**
   - Include at root level
   - Links to planning and implementation

### Do NOT Include in Template

1. **Actual project content**
   - No filled-in examples
   - Just structure and guidance

2. **Empty placeholder files**
   - Don't create phase_2/3/4 empty files
   - Let users create as needed

3. **Version numbers in filenames**
   - Template files don't need versions
   - Just explain versioning convention

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this audit** - Confirm structure is correct
2. **Identify gaps** - Any missing documents or sections?
3. **Finalize template scope** - What goes in company template?
4. **Create clean template** - Based on this successful structure
5. **Test template** - Use for next project
