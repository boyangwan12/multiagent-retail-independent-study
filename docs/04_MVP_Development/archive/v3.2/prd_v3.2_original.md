## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview

The Demand Forecasting & Inventory Allocation System is a **3-agent AI system** designed to help fashion retailers optimize category-level demand forecasting, inventory allocation, and markdown timing for seasonal products. The system uses hierarchical forecasting methodology combined with agentic workflows to reduce forecast complexity while maintaining actionable granularity.

**Core Innovation:**
- **Forecast once** at category level (e.g., "Women's Dresses: 8,000 units over 12 weeks")
- **Allocate with math** using K-means clustering (3 clusters) and historical patterns
- **Adapt dynamically** via variance monitoring (>20% triggers automated re-forecast)

### 1.2 Business Problem

Fashion retailers face critical challenges that result in significant financial losses:

1. **Inaccurate Demand Forecasting (PP-001, PP-019):**
   - Traditional ML models achieve only 20%+ forecast error on new product launches
   - Result: Poor manufacturing decisions → $500K+ lost margin annually

2. **Location-Specific Allocation Failures (PP-002, PP-015):**
   - Store-level demand patterns not captured → inventory misallocation
   - Impact: Stockouts in high-demand stores, overstock in low-demand stores
   - Cost: 5 hrs/week manual firefighting + ongoing carrying costs

3. **Late Markdown Decisions (PP-016):**
   - 3-day data lag prevents timely price reductions
   - Impact: **$500K lost margin annually** from missed markdown timing

4. **Long Manufacturing Lead Times (PP-001):**
   - Must commit to quantities 3-6 months before season launch
   - No sales history for new products → high forecast error → expensive overproduction or stockouts

### 1.3 Solution Overview

A hierarchical 3-agent system that:

**Agent 1: Demand Agent**
- Ensemble forecasting (Prophet + ARIMA in parallel, averaged)
- K-means store clustering (K=3, 7 features, StandardScaler normalization)
- Store allocation factors (70% historical + 30% attributes)

**Agent 2: Inventory Agent**
- Manufacturing order calculation (forecast + 20% safety stock)
- Hierarchical allocation (55% initial to stores, 45% DC holdback)
- Weekly replenishment (simple formula: forecast - inventory)

**Agent 3: Pricing Agent**
- Week 6 markdown checkpoint (60% sell-through target)
- Gap × Elasticity formula (elasticity=2.0, tunable, 5% rounding, 40% cap)
- Uniform markdown across all stores

**Orchestrator:**
- Workflow coordination (sequential agent handoffs)
- Variance monitoring (>20% triggers re-forecast)
- Human-in-the-loop (Modify/Accept approval modals)

### 1.4 Expected Business Impact

| Benefit | Target | Timeline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Reduce Overstock** | 15-25% reduction | 6-12 months |
| **Reduce Stockouts** | 20-30% reduction | 6-12 months |
| **Optimize Manufacturing Orders** | 15% reduction in markdown costs | 12 months |
| **Improve Replenishment** | 10-15% inventory turnover improvement | 6-12 months |
| **Data-Driven Markdowns** | Maximize revenue, minimize leftover inventory | Immediate |

## 13. Out of Scope

### 13.1 Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP

**Multi-Archetype Support:**
- ❌ Archetype 2 (Stable Catalog Retail)
- ❌ Archetype 3 (Continuous Replenishment Retail)
- ❌ Classifier Agent (auto-route to archetype)
- **Reason:** MVP focuses on proving concept with single archetype (Fashion Retail)

**SKU-Level Forecasting:**
- ❌ Individual SKU demand forecasting
- ❌ SKU attributes (color, size, style)
- ❌ New SKU forecasting (no sales history)
- **Reason:** Category-level forecasting is MVP scope, SKU-level adds 100x complexity

**Store-Level Granular Forecasting:**
- ❌ Store × Week direct forecasting (600 predictions)
- ❌ Store-specific seasonality adjustments
- **Reason:** Hierarchical allocation (cluster → store) is more scalable

**Multi-Season Overlap:**
- ❌ Concurrent forecasting for multiple seasons (e.g., Spring + Summer)
- ❌ Leftover inventory carryover to next season
- **Reason:** MVP focuses on single 12-week season

**Store-to-Store Transfers:**
- ❌ Lateral replenishment between stores
- ❌ Emergency stock transfers
- **Reason:** DC-to-store replenishment only for MVP simplicity

**Confidence Scoring:**
- ❌ Forecast confidence intervals (removed in v3.2)
- ❌ Confidence-based approval thresholds
- **Reason:** User decision - "too complicated, I want to just skip this"

**Cluster-Specific Markdowns:**
- ❌ Different markdown % per cluster (e.g., 10% Fashion_Forward, 15% Mainstream)
- **Reason:** Uniform markdown simplifies MVP, cluster-specific adds complexity

**Advanced Features:**
- ❌ Parameter tuning UI (display-only in MVP)
- ❌ PDF export of performance reports
- ❌ Email notifications for variance alerts
- ❌ Mobile app (desktop-first)
- ❌ Multi-user authentication (single-user local dev)
- ❌ Real-time POS data integration (CSV uploads only)
- ❌ External data sources (weather, fashion trends, social media) - optional in MVP

---

### 13.2 Post-MVP Roadmap

**Phase 2 (6-12 months):**
- Multi-archetype support (Archetype 2 + 3)
- Classifier Agent (auto-route based on business characteristics)
- Parameter tuning UI (adjust safety stock, holdback %, elasticity)
- Cluster-specific markdowns
- PDF export of performance reports

**Phase 3 (12-18 months):**
- SKU-level forecasting (hierarchical: category → SKU)
- New SKU forecasting (transfer learning from similar SKUs)
- Store-to-store transfers
- Multi-season overlap management
- Real-time POS data integration (replace CSV uploads)

**Phase 4 (18-24 months):**
- Production deployment (cloud infrastructure)
- Multi-user authentication (SSO)
- Mobile app (responsive design)
- External data sources integration (weather, fashion trends)
- AI-powered parameter recommendations (auto-tune based on performance)

## 15. Appendix

### 15.1 Glossary

**Category-Level Forecasting:** Predicting aggregate demand for a product category (e.g., "Women's Dresses") rather than individual SKUs.

**Hierarchical Allocation:** Top-down allocation approach (category → cluster → store).

**Store Clustering:** Grouping stores using K-means (K=3) based on 7 features with StandardScaler normalization.

**Holdback Percentage:** % of inventory kept at DC instead of allocated to stores (45% for Archetype 1).

**MAPE:** Mean Absolute Percentage Error - forecast accuracy metric.

**Markdown:** Price reduction to accelerate sales (calculated via Gap × Elasticity formula).

**Replenishment:** Periodic shipment from DC to stores to restock inventory (simple formula: forecast - inventory).

**Safety Stock:** Extra inventory buffer to avoid stockouts (20% above forecast for Archetype 1).

**Sell-Through Rate:** % of manufactured inventory sold by a given week.

**Variance Threshold:** % deviation that triggers re-forecasting (20% for Archetype 1).

**Gap × Elasticity:** Markdown formula where `Markdown = (target - actual) × elasticity_coefficient`.

**Ensemble Forecasting:** Prophet + ARIMA run in parallel, results averaged.

**K-means++:** K-means initialization algorithm that improves cluster quality.

**StandardScaler:** Normalization technique (mean=0, std=1) for feature scaling before clustering.

**Responses API:** OpenAI's production-ready API for agentic workflows (successor to Chat Completions).

**Context-Rich Handoffs:** Passing forecast/allocation objects directly between agents (no database queries).

**Dynamic Handoff Enabling:** Re-forecast handoff enabled only when variance >20%.

**Human-in-the-Loop:** Critical decisions require approval (Modify/Accept modals).

**WebSocket:** Real-time bidirectional communication protocol for agent progress streaming.
