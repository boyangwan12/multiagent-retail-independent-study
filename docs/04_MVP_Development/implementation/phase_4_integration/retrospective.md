## Technical Debt Incurred 🔧

*List any technical debt created during Phase 4.*

Technical debt is not inherently bad - sometimes it's a strategic trade-off to meet deadlines. The key is to document it.

| Debt ID | Description | Severity | Estimated Effort to Fix | When to Fix |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------------------|-------------|
| TD-4-001 | [Description of technical debt] | Low / Medium / High | [X hours] | Phase X |
| TD-4-002 | [Description of technical debt] | Low / Medium / High | [X hours] | Phase X |
| TD-4-003 | [Description of technical debt] | Low / Medium / High | [X hours] | Phase X |

**Severity Guide:**
- **Low:** Cosmetic issue, minor code smell, doesn't affect functionality
- **Medium:** Affects maintainability or performance, should be fixed in next 2-3 phases
- **High:** Affects functionality or scalability, should be fixed in next phase
