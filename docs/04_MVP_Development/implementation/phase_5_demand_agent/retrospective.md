## Blockers & Resolutions

### Blocker 1: TBD
**Issue:** TBD
**Duration:** TBD
**Resolution:** TBD
**Prevention:** TBD

---

## Technical Debt

**Intentional Shortcuts:**
- Simple ensemble average (not weighted by accuracy) - sufficient for MVP, can optimize later
- K=3 fixed (not dynamic) - acceptable for MVP, industry standard
- LLM reasoning for logging only (not execution) - fast, deterministic base logic
- Prophet/ARIMA configuration not tuned per category - default settings work well

**Unintentional Debt:**
- TBD (document any unplanned shortcuts taken during implementation)

---

## Handoff Notes for Phase 6 (Inventory Agent)

**What Phase 6 needs to know:**
- Demand Agent returns structured `ForecastResult` object
- Forecast includes: total forecast, weekly curve, cluster distribution, store allocations, safety stock multiplier
- Safety stock adjusted based on replenishment strategy (20%-25%)
- Clustering creates 3 clusters: Fashion_Forward, Mainstream, Value_Conscious
- Store allocation factors are hybrid: 70% historical + 30% attributes
- Ensemble forecast averages Prophet + ARIMA (both run in parallel)
- Re-forecast logic updates remaining weeks when variance >20%

**Forecast Object Structure:**
```python
{
    "method": "ensemble",
    "total_forecast": 8000,
    "weekly_curve": [650, 680, 720, ...],
    "cluster_distribution": [
        {"cluster_name": "Fashion_Forward", "percentage": 0.40, "units": 3200},
        {"cluster_name": "Mainstream", "percentage": 0.35, "units": 2800},
        {"cluster_name": "Value_Conscious", "percentage": 0.25, "units": 2000}
    ],
    "store_allocations": [
        {"store_id": "Store_01", "cluster_name": "Fashion_Forward", "allocation_factor": 0.055, "season_total_units": 176},
        ...
    ],
    "safety_stock_multiplier": 1.25,
    "safety_stock_reasoning": "No replenishment configured, using 25% buffer",
    "prophet_forecast": 8200,
    "arima_forecast": 7800,
    "model_agreement_pct": 95.2,
    "silhouette_score": 0.52
}
```

**Recommendations for Phase 6:**
1. Calculate manufacturing order: `total_forecast × safety_stock_multiplier`
   - Example: 8000 × 1.25 = 10,000 units
2. Use `store_allocations` for initial Week 0 allocation
   - Fashion_Forward cluster: 3,200 units → distribute to 20 stores via allocation_factor
   - Store_01: 3,200 × 0.055 = 176 units
3. Apply DC holdback parameter (from parameters)
   - Zara (0% holdback): Ship all 176 units to Store_01 at Week 0
   - Standard retail (45% holdback): Ship 176 × 0.55 = 97 units, hold 79 units at DC
4. Use `weekly_curve` for replenishment calculations (if replenishment_strategy != "none")
5. Test with both Zara parameters (25% safety stock, 0% holdback) and standard retail (20% safety stock, 45% holdback)
6. Reference `process_workflow_v3.3.md` for complete Inventory Agent behavior
