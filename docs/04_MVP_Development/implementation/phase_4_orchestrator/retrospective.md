# Phase 4: Orchestrator Agent - Retrospective

**Phase:** 4 of 8
**Agent:** `*agent dev`
**Status:** Not Started (Complete AFTER phase completion)

---

## Phase Summary

**Start Date:** TBD
**End Date:** TBD
**Actual Duration:** TBD
**Estimated Duration:** 4-5 days

**Final Deliverables:**
- [ ] Orchestrator agent with parameter-driven workflow coordination
- [ ] Variance monitoring system (>20% threshold detection)
- [ ] Conditional phase execution (skip replenishment/markdown based on parameters)
- [ ] Context-rich handoffs to 3 agents (demand, inventory, pricing)
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop approval workflow (manufacturing, markdown)
- [ ] WebSocket status streaming for real-time updates
- [ ] LLM reasoning integration for workflow decisions
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Success Metrics:**
- Workflow execution time: Target <60s, Actual: TBD
- Variance detection accuracy: Target >90%, Actual: TBD
- Phase skip logic correctness: Target 100%, Actual: TBD
- WebSocket message delivery: Target >99%, Actual: TBD

## Blockers & Resolutions

### Blocker 1: TBD
**Issue:** TBD
**Duration:** TBD
**Resolution:** TBD
**Prevention:** TBD

---

## Technical Debt

**Intentional Shortcuts:**
- Synchronous workflow execution (no Celery) - acceptable for local MVP, migrate for production
- Simple if/else phase skip logic (no rules engine) - sufficient for MVP parameter set
- LLM reasoning for logging only (not execution) - fast, deterministic
- Agent implementations still mocked - actual logic in Phase 5-7

**Unintentional Debt:**
- TBD (document any unplanned shortcuts taken during implementation)

---

## Handoff Notes for Phase 5 (Demand Agent)

**What Phase 5 needs to know:**
- Orchestrator agent fully functional with parameter-driven workflow
- Variance monitoring working (>20% triggers re-forecast)
- Conditional phase execution tested (Zara vs standard retail parameters)
- Context-rich handoffs implemented (full objects passed)
- Human approval workflow functional (manufacturing approval tested)
- WebSocket streaming working for real-time status updates

**Orchestrator Capabilities:**
- Receives parameters from Phase 0 (parameter extraction)
- Hands off to Demand Agent with parameter context
- Waits for human approval of manufacturing order
- Monitors weekly variance and triggers re-forecast if >20%
- Conditionally skips phases based on parameters
- Handles agent failures with retry logic

**Recommendations for Phase 5:**
1. Implement actual Prophet + ARIMA forecasting (replace mocks)
2. Implement K-means clustering with 7 features
3. Use parameter context from orchestrator (replenishment_strategy affects safety stock)
4. Return structured forecast object for orchestrator handoff
5. Test with both Zara parameters (no replenishment) and standard retail (weekly replenishment)
6. Reference process_workflow_v3.3.md for complete Demand Agent behavior

## Workflow Test Results (TBD after implementation)

**Test 1: Zara Parameters (No Replenishment)**
- Parameters: 12 weeks, no replenishment, 0% holdback, Week 6 markdown
- Expected: Phase 3 (replenishment) skipped
- Actual: TBD
- Result: TBD

**Test 2: Standard Retail Parameters (Weekly Replenishment)**
- Parameters: 12 weeks, weekly replenishment, 45% holdback, Week 6 markdown
- Expected: Phase 3 (replenishment) executed
- Actual: TBD
- Result: TBD

**Test 3: Variance Detection**
- Week 5 variance: 31.8% (from Phase 1 CSV data)
- Expected: Re-forecast triggered (>20%)
- Actual: TBD
- Result: TBD

**Test 4: Human Approval Workflow**
- Manufacturing approval requested
- User clicks "Accept"
- Expected: Workflow resumes to Phase 2
- Actual: TBD
- Result: TBD

**Completed:** TBD
**Completed By:** `*agent dev`
