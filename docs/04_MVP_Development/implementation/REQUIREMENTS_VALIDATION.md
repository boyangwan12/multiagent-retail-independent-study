## 🔍 Gap Analysis - Items Found in Planning Docs

### Minor Discrepancies (Non-Blocking)

1. **API Endpoint Naming**
   - **Planning:** `POST /api/workflows/forecast`, `POST /api/agents/demand/forecast`
   - **Implementation:** Generic placeholders like `/api/data/upload-*`, `/api/forecast/generate`
   - **Impact:** LOW - Implementation guide provides conceptual structure, Phase 3 will use exact planning doc endpoints
   - **Action:** ✅ Acceptable - agents will reference planning/3_technical_architecture_v3.3.md for exact API specs

2. **Some PRD User Stories Not Explicitly Listed**
   - **Planning:** planning/4_prd_v3.3.md contains user stories
   - **Implementation:** IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE focuses on technical deliverables
   - **Impact:** LOW - User stories are acceptance criteria, not technical tasks
   - **Action:** ✅ Acceptable - agents can reference PRD for acceptance criteria during development

### ✅ All Critical Requirements Verified Present

**Data Generation:** All CSV specs, validation rules, scenarios ✅
**Frontend:** All 7 sections, components, interactions ✅
**Backend:** All data models, API structure, WebSocket ✅
**Agents:** All tools, functions, parameter adaptations ✅
**Parameter-Driven (v3.3):** LLM extraction, reasoning, adaptations ✅
**Success Metrics:** MAPE, runtime, accuracy targets ✅
