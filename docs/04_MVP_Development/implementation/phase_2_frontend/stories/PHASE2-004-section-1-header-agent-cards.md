## Story

As a user,
I want to see a fixed header with scenario details and real-time agent progress cards,
So that I can track the forecast workflow execution at a glance.

**Business Value:** Provides transparency into the multi-agent workflow. Users see which agent is working and overall progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Fixed header with scenario name, date range, progress bar
2. ✅ 3 agent cards (Demand, Inventory, Pricing)
3. ✅ WebSocket mock for agent status updates
4. ✅ Animated transitions: Idle → Thinking → Complete
5. ✅ Agent icons (lucide-react)
6. ✅ Progress indicators per agent
