- **Time Lost**: 7.5 hours/week
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent data formats, missing values
- **Impact**: Downstream analysis errors
- **Current Workaround**: Manual review checklist
- **Solution Opportunity**: Automated validation rules

#### ðŸŸ¡ **Bottleneck #3: Exception Review**
- **Time Lost**: 2 hours/week
- **Root Cause**: No intelligent filtering of what needs attention
- **Impact**: Time wasted on stable products
- **Current Workaround**: Review everything
- **Solution Opportunity**: AI-powered anomaly detection

#### ðŸŸ¡ **Bottleneck #4: Cross-Team Communication**
- **Time Lost**: 4.5 hours/week
- **Root Cause**: No shared platform, email delays
- **Impact**: Misalignment, rework
- **Current Workaround**: Multiple check-in meetings
