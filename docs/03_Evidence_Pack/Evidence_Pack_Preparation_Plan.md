# Evidence Pack Preparation Plan

**Project:** Multi-Agent Retail Demand Forecasting System
**Date Created:** October 1, 2025
**Purpose:** Guide for creating comprehensive evidence pack to validate problem, solution, and user needs

---

## Overview

The Evidence Pack will serve as the comprehensive validation document that demonstrates:
- **Problem exists** (from user research)
- **Problem is significant** (quantified impact)
- **User needs are understood** (requirements derived from interviews)
- **General approach direction is validated** (expert feedback on problem-solving approach)

---

## Evidence Pack Components

### Component 1: Problem Statement & Validation
**File:** `01_Problem_Validation.md`

#### What to Include:
- **Synthesized Pain Points** across all 5 interviews
- **Problem Severity Matrix** (based on INT-001's rating system)
- **Root Cause Analysis** (flowchart from INT-001)
- **Impact Quantification** (time lost, costs, frequency)

#### Source Materials:
- INT-001: Traditional ML accuracy issues, inventory misallocation, cross-border complexity
- INT-002-004: [Extract pain points from remaining interviews]
- INT-005: Data quality (50% time on cleaning), manual interventions, inventory optimization challenges

#### Steps to Create:
1. Extract all pain points from 5 interview notes
2. Categorize by theme (forecast accuracy, data integration, agility, cost)
3. Create consolidated severity matrix
4. Map cascading impacts (poor forecast → misallocation → redistribution costs)
5. Add supporting quotes from interviews

---

### Component 2: User Research Synthesis
**File:** `02_User_Research_Synthesis.md`

#### What to Include:
- **Interview Summary Table** (ID, role, company type, key insights)
- **User Personas** (3 types: Furniture Retail, Fashion Retail, CPG)
- **Current Workflow Documentation** (use INT-001's mermaid diagrams)
- **Key Quotes Library** (organized by theme)
- **Research Methodology** (how interviews were conducted)

#### Source Materials:
- All 5 interview notes (INT-001 through INT-005)
- Interview transcripts (INT-004, INT-005)
- Interview prep documents (Interview_Guide_Retail_Operations.md, Interview_Strategy.md)

#### Steps to Create:
1. Create interview summary table with all 5 participants
2. Extract and organize quotes by theme:
   - Forecast accuracy challenges
   - Seasonality factors
   - Data integration needs
   - Multi-channel complexity
3. Document 2-3 workflow diagrams representing different retail contexts
4. Create user persona profiles with goals, pain points, needs
5. Document interview methodology and approach

---

### Component 3: Requirements & Constraints Documentation
**File:** `03_Requirements_Constraints.md`

#### What to Include:
- **Functional Requirements** (what the system must do)
- **Data Requirements** (sources, granularity, history needed)
- **Seasonality Definition** (event-based, not just weather)
- **Technical Constraints** (omnichannel, store-level, scalability)
- **Scope Boundaries** (Vaibhav's warning: focus on ONE domain)

#### Source Materials:
- INT-005: Detailed data factors (weather, social media, inventory, demographics, historical, product placement)
- INT-005: Seasonality events (Black Friday, Christmas, Halloween, back-to-school)
- INT-001: Cross-border requirements, location-based predictions
- Multi-agent pitch: Technical specifications, scalability targets

#### Steps to Create:
1. List all functional requirements extracted from interviews:
   - Seasonal intelligence (event-based)
   - Multi-data source integration
   - Store-level forecasting
   - Inventory reallocation support
   - Continuous learning capability
2. Document data requirements:
   - Historical sales (10+ years from INT-005)
   - Real-time inventory
   - External factors (weather, demographics, macro)
   - Seasonality markers
3. Define technical constraints:
   - Omnichannel architecture
   - Store-to-store transfer logic
   - Scalability (10,000+ SKUs from pitch)
4. Establish scope boundaries:
   - Focus: Sales forecasting for specific SKUs at store level during seasonal events
   - Out of scope: Revenue optimization, finance, pricing (per INT-005)

---

### Component 4: Solution Direction Validation
**File:** `04_Approach_Validation.md`

#### What to Include:

- **Conceptual Validation** (experts confirming general direction without technical details)
- **Design Principles Supported by Research** (why certain approaches align with needs)
- **Expert Reactions** (what experts said about problem-solving concepts)

#### Source Materials:
- All interview notes (validation points only)
- INT-001: Interest in AI/LLM vs traditional ML, need for agility
- INT-005: Multiple data sources needed, correlation analysis approach

#### Steps to Create:
1. Document user preferences on approach:
   - "AI/LLM preferred over traditional ML" (INT-001)
   - "Need for multiple data source integration" (INT-005)
   - "System must be agile and adaptive" (INT-001)
   - "Continuous learning capability needed" (multiple interviews)

2. Extract conceptual validation (NOT technical architecture):
   - Users want intelligence that adapts to context
   - Users need multi-factor consideration
   - Users value systems that self-improve
   - Users need transparency in decision-making

3. Note expert reactions to general concepts:
   - INT-001: Expressed interest in exploring AI-based approaches
   - INT-005: Confirmed importance of correlation analysis and feature selection
   - General consensus: Traditional approaches insufficient

**IMPORTANT:** This section validates the DIRECTION (AI-based, multi-source, adaptive) but does NOT include:

2. **Then:** Begin Phase 1 (Data Extraction)
3. **Follow:** Phase 2 (Document Creation)
4. **Finalize:** Phase 3 (Integration & Review)

---

## Notes

- **Missing Interview Data:** Need to review INT-002, INT-003, INT-004 to complete picture
- **Visual Strategy:** Focus on current-state workflow diagrams, problem cascades, and user journey maps
- **Validation Opportunity:** INT-001 offered access to planning team after MVP - document this as validation checkpoint
- **Expert Review:** INT-005 (Vaibhav) offered to review project - leverage this for final validation
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep Evidence Pack focused on PROBLEM validation. Create separate Technical Design Document for SOLUTION architecture.
