Measurable improvement over traditional ML baselines, with specific focus on:
- Store-level granularity (not just regional/national aggregates)
- SKU-level precision (not just category-level)
- Event-based seasonality capture (Black Friday, Christmas, weather events)

**Target Improvement:**
- **Minimum:** 5-10 percentage point improvement over baseline (65-80% → 70-85%)
- **Aspirational:** 15+ percentage point improvement (achieving 75-85% SKU-level accuracy)

**Measurement Methodology:**
1. Calculate forecast vs. actual sales using MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
2. Measure at SKU-store level, then aggregate to category and regional levels
3. Track accuracy over multiple seasonal events (minimum 2-3 event cycles)
4. Compare against baseline traditional ML model performance on same dataset
5. Segment accuracy by:
   - Product category (fashion vs. seasonal vs. staples)
   - Store type (A/B/C classification)
   - Event type (promotional vs. non-promotional periods)
   - Weather sensitivity (weather-dependent vs. weather-independent categories)

**Validation Checkpoints:**
- Weekly accuracy monitoring during in-season periods
- Post-event accuracy review within 7 days of event completion
- Quarterly trend analysis to identify improvement trajectory
