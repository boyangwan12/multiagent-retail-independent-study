# Phase 1: Mock Data Generation - Technical Decisions

**Phase:** Phase 1
**Agent:** `*agent dev`
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-14

---

## Overview

This document records all significant technical decisions made during Phase 1 implementation. Each decision includes context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

---

## Decision Log

*Decisions will be added as implementation progresses. Document each significant choice during coding, not after.*

---

## Technology Stack

### Chosen Technologies

| Component | Technology | Version | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Language | Python | 3.11+ | Project standard, required for Phase 2 backend |
| Data Processing | pandas | Latest | Efficient CSV handling, DataFrame operations |
| Numerical | numpy | Latest | Random number generation, vectorized operations |

### Rejected Technologies

| Technology | Reason for Rejection |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Faker library | Not needed - custom logic simpler for retail domain |
| Prophet | Too heavy for mock data generation, use in Phase 2 only |

## Code Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Functions: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Classes: `PascalCase` (if needed)

```

### Testing Approach
- Validation suite covers 6 check types
- MAPE validation ensures realistic accuracy
- Manual testing with 3 scenarios
