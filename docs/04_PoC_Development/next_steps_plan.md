**Key Screens**:
- Dashboard: Category forecast overview (8,000 dresses forecast)
- Cluster view: Fashion_Forward 40% / Mainstream 35% / Value_Conscious 25%
- Store allocation: Table showing Store_01: 176 dresses, Store_02: 160, etc.
- Replenishment tracker: Weekly cycles, variance alerts
- Markdown manager: Week 6 checkpoint, cluster-specific pricing
- Performance metrics: MAPE, sell-through rate, business impact

**Output**: `docs/04_PoC_Development/design/ux_design.md`

---

### 3. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** üìã
**Owner**: `*agent pm` (Product Manager Agent)
**Purpose**: Functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
**Key User Stories**:
- "As a merchandiser, I want to see category-level forecast so I can approve manufacturing orders"
- "As a merchandiser, I want to see store allocations by cluster so I can validate distribution"
- "As a merchandiser, I want to receive markdown recommendations at Week 6"
- "As a system, I want to auto-trigger re-forecast when variance exceeds 20%"

**Output**: `docs/04_PoC_Development/prd/prd.md` (or use existing PRD structure)

---

### 4. **Data Requirements & Sample Data** üìä
**Owner**: `*agent data` or `*agent architect`
**Purpose**: Define data schemas, sample datasets for testing
**What You Need**:
- Historical sales data structure (2-3 years, category-level)
- Store attributes (size, demographics, location, fashion tier)
- Sample dataset: 50 stores √ó 12 weeks √ó Women's Dresses category
- External factors (optional): weather, trends, seasonality

**Output**: `docs/04_PoC_Development/data/data_requirements.md`

---

### 5. **Agent Implementation Specs** ü§ñ
**Owner**: `*agent architect` + `*agent dev`
**Purpose**: OpenAI Agents SDK implementation details for 3 agents
**Per Agent**:
- **Demand Agent**: Time-series forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet), clustering (K-means), allocation factors
- **Inventory Agent**: Manufacturing calculation, hierarchical allocation, replenishment logic
- **Pricing Agent**: Sell-through tracking, markdown decision tree, re-forecast triggers
- **Orchestrator**: Workflow coordination, variance monitoring, human-in-the-loop

**Output**: `docs/04_PoC_Development/architecture/agent_specs.md`

## Recommended Sequence

### **Phase 1: Architecture & Design** (Week 1-2)
1. **Talk to `*agent architect`**
   - Define tech stack (Python + OpenAI Agents SDK + React + PostgreSQL?)
   - Design 3-agent system architecture
   - Define data models and API contracts

2. **Talk to `*agent designer`**
   - Design UI screens for merchandiser persona
   - Wireframes for forecast dashboard, allocation table, markdown manager
   - Define interaction patterns (alerts, approvals, drill-downs)

### **Phase 2: Requirements & Planning** (Week 2-3)
3. **Talk to `*agent pm`**
   - Write PRD with user stories
   - Define MVP scope (Archetype 1 only, single category)
   - Acceptance criteria for each feature

4. **Talk to `*agent data`** (or architect)
   - Define data schemas
   - Create sample dataset (or find public retail dataset)
   - Data pipeline design (CSV ‚Üí preprocessing ‚Üí agents)

### **Phase 3: Implementation** (Week 4-8)
5. **Talk to `*agent dev`**
   - Implement 3 agents using OpenAI Agents SDK
   - Build forecasting pipeline (category-level)
   - Build allocation logic (hierarchical)
   - Build replenishment logic (weekly cycles)
   - Build markdown logic (Week 6 checkpoint)

6. **Build Frontend**
   - React dashboard for merchandiser
   - Connect to agent APIs
   - Display forecasts, allocations, recommendations

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation** (Week 9-10)
7. **Talk to `*agent qa`**
   - Test with sample dataset
   - Validate MAPE < 20%
   - Test variance-triggered re-forecast
   - Test markdown recommendations

8. **Hindcast validation**: Use historical data (Spring 2024) to validate forecast accuracy

## Recommended First Step

**Start with `*agent architect`** to define:
1. Tech stack (OpenAI Agents SDK + Python + React + DB?)
2. How 3 agents will be implemented
3. Data models and APIs
4. Deployment strategy (local vs cloud)

Once architecture is clear, move to `*agent designer` for UI/UX, then `*agent pm` for detailed requirements.
