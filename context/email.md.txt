Hi Boyang, Henry, Yina, and Jintao,
Thanks for reaching out and for your interest in agentic AI. I’m open to supervising an independent study focused on a practical multi agent system for retail operations (demand forecasting, inventory & allocation, pricing/markdowns, procurement, assortment, trend sensing). The end goal is a credible MVP and a rigorous write up, not a toy demo.
What you’ll do
1.	Discovery (mandatory, no AI): Conduct ≥5 structured interviews with retailers to surface real workflows, exceptions, rules, KPIs, and data schemas. Output: a PRD grounded in facts, plus an evidence pack (coded themes, frequencies, and de identified observations).
2.	Architecture: From the PRD, draft a system design for an orchestrator coordinating specialized agents (e.g., demand, allocation, pricing), with tool integrations, memory, evaluation harness, and safety/guardrails.
3.	Build: Implement an MVP using agent frameworks (e.g., OpenAI’s Agents SDK and Google’s ADK) with synthetic or non confidential data, plus an evaluation plan that proves usefulness and reliability.
Cadence: Weekly 30 minute check ins. Come prepared with decisions, blockers, and artifacts. My bar is high; this is a results first project.
Transparency & boundaries (read carefully)
•	Student ownership: You own your code and documents. I will not ask you to transfer or license your IP for my company.
•	No startup sponsorship: Although I’m a founder of OODARIS, OODARIS is not a sponsor and will not receive non public materials from this course. Your work will not be used at OODARIS. I already have my own codebase, architecture, and PRD outside the course.
•	Interviews & confidentiality: We will obtain the appropriate course based ethics determination and use a consent form. Collect non confidential process information only; no trade secrets, proprietary data, or PII. Do not upload interview content to external LLMs or APIs.
•	Data handling: Use open/synthetic data for the build. Store notes and outputs in the course repo. You may publish sanitized results after grading at your discretion.
Deliverables (high level)
•	Interview Guide + Consent
•	Evidence Pack (de identified, coded findings)
•	PRD (grounded in interviews)
•	Architecture Doc
•	MVP + Evaluation Results
•	Final Demo + Technical Report
If this scope and these boundaries work for you, reply with confirmation and three proposed retailers to target first. I’ll then share a kickoff checklist and we’ll schedule our first meeting.

Subject: Request for Independent Study Supervision: Agentic AI Projects 
 
Dear Dr. Nâyebi,
 
We are writing to ask if you would consider supervising and mentoring our independent study for the upcoming final semester. I have been reading your book and following the rapid developments in AI and are particularly fascinated by agentic AI frameworks. The capabilities of AI agents often blow my mind. I think the new revolution is approaching and I really want to be part of it. My goal for the study is to move beyond theory and get hands-on experience building a practical application based on this exciting concept.

We are currently in the early ideation stage and wanted to share a couple of initial ideas to give you a sense of our interests. We are very flexible and would look forward to refining these or exploring a new direction with your guidance.
 
Here are two project ideas we've been thinking about:
 
1. Insight Hub: Do you still remember that video about the newest AI tool from yesterday? You probably liked it but won't check it again. To solve the problem of valuable insights getting lost in social media feeds, this app would use AI agents to automatically collect, summarize, and organize posts about AI trends and financial news from sources like X and LinkedIn. The architecture would involve specialized agents for data collection, processing, and reporting.
               
2. Photographer's Roadtrip Planner: To address the disjointed planning process for photographers, this app would be an all-in-one tool where a main "orchestrator" agent coordinates with specialized agents for mapping, weather, and calculating optimal shooting light (like golden hour) to build a perfect, photo-centric itinerary.
 
Regardless of the specific application we choose, our core technical exploration would focus on the design of the multi-agent framework itself. This involves defining clear roles for each agent, establishing a robust communication protocol for them to interact, and implementing a central orchestrator that can decompose high-level goals into sub-tasks. We plan to leverage foundational frameworks like LangChain, Langgraph, while focusing our custom development on the API integrations that grant the agents their "tools" and the strategic logic that governs their collaboration.
 
Again, these are just starting points for a conversation. We are very eager to learn and would be thrilled to develop a project under your mentorship. Thank you for your time and consideration!!!
 
Best regards,
Boyang Wan
